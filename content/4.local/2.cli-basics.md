The CLI is the fastest way to manage projects and run MCP tools directly from the terminal.

## Use the short alias

`bm` is a short alias for `basic-memory`.

## List and create projects

```bash
bm project list
bm project add "research" ~/Documents/research
```

## Set the default project

```bash
bm project default "research"
```

## Search notes

```bash
bm tools search-notes --query "authentication"
```

## Read and write notes

```bash
bm tools read-note --path "docs/api-auth.md"

echo "New note content" | bm tools write-note --path "drafts/notes.md"
```
