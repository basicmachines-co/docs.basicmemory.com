The CLI is the fastest way to manage projects and run MCP tools directly from the terminal.

## Use the short alias

`bm` is a short alias for `basic-memory`.

## List and create projects

```bash
bm project list
bm project add "research" ~/Documents/research
```

## Set the default project

```bash
bm project default "research"
```

## Search notes

```bash
bm tool search-notes --query "authentication"
```

Semantic modes:

```bash
bm tool search-notes --query "authentication architecture" --search-type hybrid
bm tool search-notes --query "login flow" --search-type vector
```

## Read and write notes

```bash
bm tool read-note "docs/api-auth.md"

echo "New note content" | bm tool write-note --title "Notes" --folder "drafts"
```

## Schema workflows

```bash
bm schema infer person
bm schema validate person
bm schema diff person
```

## Watch for file changes

```bash
bm watch
bm watch --project research
```
