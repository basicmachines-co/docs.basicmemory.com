## Basic Memory Workflow

Using Basic Memory follows a natural cycle:

::mermaid
---
code: |
  flowchart LR
      A[Conversation] --> B[Capture]
      B --> C[Connect]
      C --> D[Reference]
      D --> E[Edit]
      E --> F[Sync]
      F --> A

::

1. **Have conversations** with AI assistants like Claude
2. **Capture knowledge** in Markdown files
3. **Build connections** between pieces of knowledge
4. **Reference your knowledge** in future conversations
5. **Edit files directly** when needed
6. **Sync changes** automatically

---

## Creating Knowledge

### Through Conversations

The most natural way to create knowledge is during conversations:

```bash
You: We've covered several authentication approaches. Could you create a note
     summarizing what we've discussed?

Claude: I'll create a note summarizing our authentication discussion.

[Uses write_note tool]

Done! I've created "Authentication Approaches.md" with:
- Overview of options we discussed
- Observations about JWT vs sessions
- Relations to your security notes
```

This creates a Markdown file with semantic markup in your knowledge base.

::tip
You can store your knowledge at any location. `~/basic-memory` is the default project location. See [Getting Started](/start-here/getting-started#choosing-where-your-notes-are-saved) for more information.
::

### Direct File Creation

You can also create files directly:

1. Create a new Markdown file in your project directory
2. Add frontmatter with title, type, and optional tags
3. Structure content with observations and relations
4. Save the file - it syncs automatically

**Example file structure:**
```bash
---
title: API Design Decisions
tags: [api, architecture, decisions]
---

# API Design Decisions

## Context
We needed to choose an approach for the new API.

## Observations
- [decision] Use REST over GraphQL for simplicity #api
- [requirement] Must support versioning from day one
- [risk] Rate limiting needed for public endpoints

## Relations
- implements [[API Specification]]
- depends_on [[Authentication System]]
```

---

## Using Special Prompts

Basic Memory includes special prompts that help you leverage your knowledge base effectively.

### Continue Conversation

Resume previous topics with full context:

```bash
"Let's continue our conversation about [topic]"
```

**What happens:**
- Searches your knowledge base for relevant content
- Builds context from related documents
- Resumes with awareness of previous discussions

### Recent Activity

See what you've been working on:

```bash
"What have we been discussing recently?"
```

**What happens:**
- Retrieves recently modified documents
- Summarizes main topics and points
- Offers to continue any discussions

### Search

Find specific information:

```bash
"Find information about [topic]"
```

**What happens:**
- Searches across all your documents
- Summarizes key findings
- Offers to explore specific documents

---

## Working with Memory URLs

Basic Memory uses special `memory://` URLs to reference knowledge:

### URL Formats

```bash
memory://title                   # Reference by title
memory://folder/title            # Reference by folder and title
memory://permalink               # Reference by permalink
memory://path/relation_type/*    # Follow all relations of type
```

### Using Memory URLs

Reference existing knowledge in conversations:

```bash
You: "Take a look at memory://coffee-brewing-methods and let's discuss improvements"
```

Claude will load that specific document and any related context.

::tip
Memory URLs are stable identifiers. Even if you rename or move a file, the permalink stays the same (unless you configure otherwise).
::

---

## Building Knowledge Connections

### Creating Relations

Use WikiLink syntax to connect knowledge:

```bash
## Relations
- implements [[Authentication System]]
- requires [[Database Schema]]
- relates_to [[Security Guidelines]]
```

### Common Relation Types

| Type | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `implements` | One thing implements another |
| `requires` | Dependencies |
| `relates_to` | General connections |
| `part_of` | Hierarchy relationships |
| `extends` | Extensions or enhancements |
| `pairs_with` | Things that work together |
| `inspired_by` | Source of ideas |
| `replaces` | Supersedes another document |

### Adding Observations

Structure facts with semantic categories:

```bash
## Observations
- [decision] We chose JWT tokens for stateless auth
- [requirement] Must support 2FA for sensitive operations
- [technique] Use bcrypt for password hashing
- [issue] Rate limiting needed for login attempts
- [fact] Average response time is 50ms
- [question] Should we support OAuth?
```

---

## Multi-Project Workflows

### How Projects Work

Basic Memory supports multiple projects for organizing different knowledge bases. When you start a conversation, the AI will:

1. Check your available projects
2. Suggest the most active project based on recent activity
3. Ask which project to use for this conversation
4. Remember your choice throughout the session

**Example conversation:**
```bash
You: "Let's work on documentation"

Claude: I see you have 3 projects: main, work-notes, personal
Your most active project is work-notes.
Should I use work-notes for this task?

You: "Yes, let's use work-notes"

Claude: I'll use the 'work-notes' project for our session.
```

### Single Project Users

If you only use one project, you can skip the selection prompt. Add this to `~/.basic-memory/config.json`:

```json
{
  "default_project": "main",
  "default_project_mode": true
}
```

With this enabled, the AI uses your default project automatically. You can still override by explicitly specifying a different project.

### Single Project Mode (Locked)

For focused sessions or automation, lock the MCP server to one project:

```bash
basic-memory mcp --project work-notes
```

This **locks** the entire MCP session - the `project` parameter in tool calls will be ignored.

**When to use:**
- Automation workflows that should only access one project
- Focused sessions where you want to prevent cross-project operations
- Team environments with project-specific access

::note
**Key difference:**
- **Default Project Mode**: Uses default automatically, but can still switch
- **Single Project Mode**: Locked to one project, cannot switch
::

### Moving Notes Between Projects

::warning
Moving notes from one project to another is not currently supported directly. The easiest approach is to:
1. Copy the file manually between project directories
2. Or create a new note in the destination project, then delete the original
::

---

## File Organization

### Directory Structure

Organize files in any structure that suits you:

```bash
~/basic-memory/
├── projects/          # Active project notes
│   ├── api-redesign/
│   └── mobile-app/
├── decisions/         # Decision records
├── learning/          # Research and learning notes
├── meetings/          # Meeting notes
└── archive/           # Completed/old content
```

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive filenames
- Group related content in folders
- Include dates in time-sensitive notes (e.g., `2024-01-15 Team Standup.md`)
- Archive old content regularly

### Controlling What Gets Indexed

Basic Memory respects `.gitignore` patterns to skip sensitive files.

**Pattern sources:**
- **Global patterns**: `~/.basic-memory/.bmignore` (all projects)
- **Project patterns**: `{project}/.gitignore` (specific project)

**Example `.gitignore`:**
```gitignore
# Sensitive files
.env
*.key
credentials.json

# Build artifacts
node_modules/
__pycache__/
dist/

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

Files matching these patterns are automatically skipped during indexing.

## Enhanced Editing

### Incremental Editing

Edit notes without rewriting entire documents:

```bash
You: "Add a troubleshooting section to my setup guide"
Claude: [Uses edit_note with append operation]
"I've added a troubleshooting section to the end of your setup guide."
```

**Available operations:**
- `append` - Add content to end
- `prepend` - Add content to beginning
- `find_replace` - Replace specific text
- `replace_section` - Replace entire section by heading

### Smart File Organization

Move and rename notes with database consistency:

```bash
You: "Move my old meeting notes to the archive folder"
Claude: [Uses move_note]
"Done! I've moved 12 meeting notes to the archive folder."
```

### Directory Operations

Move or delete entire folders:

```bash
You: "Move the old-projects folder to archive"
Claude: [Uses move_note with is_directory=true]
"Moved old-projects/ → archive/old-projects/ (15 files)"

You: "Delete the empty temp folder"
Claude: [Uses delete_note with is_directory=true]
"Deleted temp/ and all 3 contained files"
```

### Enhanced Search

Tags in frontmatter are searchable:

```yaml
---
title: Coffee Notes
tags: [brewing, equipment, techniques]
---
```

Searching for "brewing notes" will find this document.

---

## Syncing and Updates

### Real-time Sync

Basic Memory automatically syncs file changes in real-time. When you edit a file in your editor:
1. The change is detected within ~1 second
2. The file is re-parsed for observations and relations
3. The database is updated
4. Search index is refreshed

No manual sync needed for normal workflows.

### Checking Status

```bash
# View sync status
basic-memory status

# View project information
basic-memory project info
```

### Force Re-sync

If something seems out of sync:

```bash
# Re-sync all files
basic-memory sync

# Reset and rebuild database (use if issues persist)
basic-memory reset
```

::warning
`basic-memory reset` rebuilds the entire database from your files. This is safe (files are never deleted) but may take time for large knowledge bases.
::

## Integration Tips

### With Obsidian

1. Open your `~/basic-memory` directory as an Obsidian vault
2. Use **Graph View** to visualize connections
3. Edit files directly in Obsidian
4. Changes sync automatically - ask the AI to read a note to see updates

<!-- TODO: Screenshot - Obsidian graph view with Basic Memory notes -->
![Obsidian graph view](/screenshots/obsidian/graph-view.png)

::tip
Obsidian's graph view is excellent for discovering unexpected connections in your knowledge base.
::

### With Git

Basic Memory files are git-friendly:

```bash
cd ~/basic-memory
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial knowledge base"
```

Benefits:
- Version history for all changes
- Backup to GitHub/GitLab
- Collaborate with others
- Track what changed over time

### With Other Editors

Basic Memory uses standard Markdown that works with:
- **VS Code** with Markdown extensions
- **Typora** for rich text editing
- **Any text editor** for quick edits
- **Web editors** for remote access

The database syncs regardless of how you edit files.

## Best Practices

### Knowledge Creation

1. **Create relations** - Link related concepts with `[[WikiLinks]]`
2. **Make observations** - Structure facts with `[category]` syntax
3. **Be descriptive** - Use clear titles and rich content
4. **Add context** - Include background and reasoning
5. **Review and refine** - Edit AI-generated content for accuracy

### Workflow

1. **Use special prompts** - "Continue conversation", "Recent activity", "Search"
2. **Build incrementally** - Add to existing notes rather than creating duplicates
3. **Organize regularly** - Move old content to archive
4. **Cross-reference** - Link new content to existing knowledge
5. **Use projects** - Separate work, personal, research

### Long-term Maintenance

1. **Archive old content** - Keep active knowledge base focused
2. **Refactor connections** - Update relations as knowledge evolves
3. **Regular reviews** - Periodically update key documents
4. **Backup regularly** - Use git, cloud sync, or snapshots

---

## Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Syncing

1. Check sync status: `basic-memory status`
2. Verify file permissions
3. Check if file matches ignore patterns
4. Reset database: `basic-memory reset`

### Claude Can't Find Knowledge

1. Confirm files are in correct project directory
2. Check frontmatter formatting (valid YAML)
3. Use `memory://` URLs for direct references
4. Trigger re-sync: `basic-memory sync`

### Performance Issues

1. Check database size: `basic-memory project info`
2. Archive old content
3. Adjust sync delay in config (default: 1000ms)
