description: Install Basic Memory locally and choose where notes live.

Local mode runs the MCP server on your machine and stores notes in local folders you control.

## Install the CLI

::code-group
```bash [uv]
uv tool install basic-memory
```

```bash [homebrew]
brew tap basicmachines-co/basic-memory
brew install basic-memory
```
::

## Start the MCP server

Configure your MCP client to run the server:

```json [claude_desktop_config.json]
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["basic-memory", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your MCP client after editing the config.

## Choose where notes live

By default, notes are stored in a `main` project under `~/basic-memory`. You can point Basic Memory to any folder by creating a project and setting it as default.

```bash
bm project add "work" ~/Documents/work-notes
bm project default "work"
```
