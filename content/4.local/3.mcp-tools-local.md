title: MCP tools (local)
description: Use MCP tools against local projects.
---

MCP tools are the same in Cloud and Local. In local mode, they operate on folders on your machine.

## Use tools in local mode

When you run the local MCP server, tools read and write local project folders by default.

## Common tools

- `search_notes` to find notes
- `read_note` to load a note
- `write_note` to create or update a note
- `edit_note` to append or replace sections

## Example

```python
search_notes(query="architecture", project="main")
```
