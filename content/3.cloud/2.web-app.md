### Use tabs to filter

Switch between views in the notes list:

|-----|-------|
| **All** | Every note in the current folder/project |
| **Recent** | Notes modified in the last 7 days |
| **Pinned** | Notes you've pinned for quick access |

### Search notes

Use the search field above the notes list to filter by title or content. Search is instant and searches the current project.

## Tips for Effective Use

### Organize with folders

Create a folder structure that matches how you think:

```bash
~/basic-memory/
├── projects/       # Active projects
├── research/       # Learning and exploration
├── decisions/      # Decision records
├── meetings/       # Meeting notes
└── archive/        # Completed/old content
```

### Use pinned notes

Pin your most-accessed notes (project overviews, quick references) for one-click access.

### Create snapshots before big changes

Before reorganizing folders, bulk importing, or deleting lots of notes - create a manual snapshot.

### Combine with AI assistant

The web app and AI assistant work together:
1. **AI creates** detailed notes during conversations
2. **You browse and refine** in the web app
3. **AI references** your refined notes in future conversations
