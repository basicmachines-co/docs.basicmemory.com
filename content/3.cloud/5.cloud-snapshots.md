title: Cloud Snapshots
description: Point-in-time backups for your Basic Memory Cloud knowledge base.
---

Basic Memory Cloud includes point-in-time snapshots for backup and recovery. Create manual snapshots before major changes, or rely on automatic daily backups.

::note{icon="i-lucide-info"}
Create as many snapshots as you need—there's no limit. Basic Memory Cloud also creates daily automatic snapshots, so you're always protected.

## What Snapshots Do

- **Rollback** to a previous state after accidental changes
- **Browse** historical versions of your notes
- **Restore** individual files or entire folders
- **Protect** against accidental deletion

---

## Using the Web App

Manage snapshots directly in your browser at [app.basicmemory.com](https://app.basicmemory.com).

::note
Restored files overwrite existing files with the same path. Consider creating a new snapshot before restoring if you want to preserve current state.

## Using the CLI

Manage snapshots from the command line with `bm cloud snapshot` commands.

### Create a Snapshot

```bash
bm cloud snapshot create "Before reorganization"
```

**Output:**
```
Created snapshot: snap_abc123 (2026-01-27T10:30:00)
```

### List Snapshots

```bash
bm cloud snapshot list
```

**Output:**
```
snap_abc123  "Before reorganization"  Jan 27, 2026  42 MB
snap_xyz789  "daily-auto"             Jan 26, 2026  41 MB
snap_def456  "daily-auto"             Jan 25, 2026  40 MB
```

### View Snapshot Details

```bash
bm cloud snapshot show snap_abc123
```

### Browse Snapshot Contents

View files in a snapshot without restoring:

```bash
bm cloud snapshot browse snap_abc123
```

**Output:**
```
notes/project.md
notes/ideas.md
research/analysis.md
meetings/2026-01-15.md
```

Filter by path:

```bash
bm cloud snapshot browse snap_abc123 --path notes/
```

### Restore Files

Restore a specific file:

```bash
bm cloud snapshot restore snap_abc123 --file notes/important.md
```

Restore an entire folder:

```bash
bm cloud snapshot restore snap_abc123 --path research/
```

### Delete a Snapshot

```bash
bm cloud snapshot delete snap_abc123
```

::warning
Deleted snapshots cannot be recovered. Make sure you no longer need the snapshot before deleting.

## When to Create Snapshots

- Before reorganizing your folder structure
- Before bulk imports from Claude or ChatGPT
- Before deleting multiple notes
- Before running automated scripts
- At project milestones

---

## Automatic Snapshots

Basic Memory Cloud creates automatic daily snapshots:

- **Frequency**: Once per day
- **Naming**: `daily-auto` prefix
- **No action required**: Happens automatically

You can rely on automatic snapshots for basic protection, but manual snapshots are recommended before major changes.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Name snapshots descriptively** - Use names like "Before Q1 reorganization" instead of "backup1"
2. **Create before bulk operations** - Imports, reorganizations, and deletions
3. **Review automatic snapshots** - Check that daily snapshots are being created
4. **Test restore occasionally** - Verify you can restore files when needed
5. **Clean up old snapshots** - Delete manual snapshots you no longer need

---

## Troubleshooting

### Snapshot Creation Failed

1. Check your subscription status: `bm cloud status`
2. Verify you're authenticated: `bm cloud login`
3. Check available storage in your account

### Can't Find a File in Snapshot

1. Use `browse` with different paths to locate the file
2. Check if the file existed at the snapshot time
3. Try an earlier snapshot if the file was deleted before the snapshot

### Restore Didn't Work

1. Check file permissions in your project
2. Verify the file path is correct
3. Try restoring to a different location first
