description: Create API keys for programmatic access to Basic Memory Cloud without OAuth.
---

API keys provide an alternative to OAuth for authenticating with Basic Memory Cloud. Use them for CLI tools, automation scripts, or any MCP client that supports bearer token authentication.

---

## Why Use API Keys?

- **Simpler setup** - No OAuth flow required
- **Automation friendly** - Use in scripts and CI/CD
- **Multiple keys** - Create separate keys for different tools
- **Revocable** - Disable a key without affecting others

---

## Creating an API Key

::steps
### Open Settings

In the [web app](https://app.basicmemory.com), go to **Settings → API Keys**

### Click Create Key

Click **Create New API Key**

### Name Your Key

Enter a descriptive name like "Claude Desktop" or "Work Laptop"

### Set Expiration (Optional)

Choose when the key should expire, or leave blank for no expiration

### Copy Your Key

**Important:** Copy the key immediately. It's only shown once and cannot be retrieved later.

The key looks like: `bmc_abc123def456...`
::

::warning
Store your API key securely. Anyone with the key can access your Basic Memory account. Never commit keys to version control or share them publicly.
::

---

## Using API Keys

### With Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "url": "https://cloud.basicmemory.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer bmc_your_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### With Codex CLI

Add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[[mcp_servers]]
name = "basic-memory"
url = "https://cloud.basicmemory.com/mcp"
bearer_token_env_var = "BASIC_MEMORY_API_KEY"
```

Then set the environment variable:

```bash
export BASIC_MEMORY_API_KEY=bmc_your_key_here
```

### With Other MCP Clients

Any MCP client that supports HTTP headers can use API keys:

```
Authorization: Bearer bmc_your_key_here
```

### With curl

Test your key with curl:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer bmc_your_key_here" \
  https://cloud.basicmemory.com/api/v2/projects
```

### With Basic Memory CLI (per-project routing)

Save a key and route only selected projects through cloud:

```bash
# Save an existing key from the web app
bm cloud set-key bmc_your_key_here

# Or create and save a new key (requires active OAuth session — run bm cloud login first)
bm cloud create-key "work-laptop"

# Route one project through cloud
bm project set-cloud research

# Revert that project to local routing
bm project set-local research
```

This lets you keep a hybrid setup where some projects stay local and others use cloud.

## Managing Keys

### View Your Keys

In **Settings → API Keys**, you'll see:
- Key name
- Key prefix (first few characters for identification)
- Creation date
- Last used timestamp
- Status (active/expired/revoked)

### Revoking a Key

To disable a key:

1. Go to **Settings → API Keys**
2. Find the key you want to revoke
3. Click **Revoke**
4. Confirm the action

Revoked keys stop working immediately. This cannot be undone.

::tip
If you suspect a key has been compromised, revoke it immediately and create a new one.
::

## Security Best Practices

### Do

- **Use descriptive names** - "Claude Desktop Work" is better than "key1"
- **Set expiration dates** - Especially for temporary access
- **Use environment variables** - Don't hardcode keys in config files
- **Revoke unused keys** - Clean up keys you no longer need
- **Create separate keys** - One per device or application

### Don't

- **Share keys** - Each user should have their own account and keys
- **Commit keys to git** - Add config files with keys to `.gitignore`
- **Use keys in URLs** - Always use the Authorization header
- **Ignore suspicious activity** - Check "last used" timestamps regularly

---

## Key Format

API keys follow this format:

```
bmc_<random-base64url-string>
```

- Prefix `bmc_` identifies it as a Basic Memory Cloud key
- 32 bytes of cryptographically random data
- URL-safe base64 encoding

Example: `bmc_K7xR2pQmNvLwYhT9sU3fAeBcDgHiJkMnOpQrStUv`

## API Keys vs OAuth

| Feature | API Keys | OAuth |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Setup | Copy/paste key | Browser-based flow |
| Best for | CLI, scripts, automation | Interactive apps |
| Token refresh | No (long-lived) | Yes (short-lived + refresh) |
| Revocation | Per-key | Per-session |
| Scopes | Full access | Configurable |

Use **API keys** for:
- Command-line tools
- Automation scripts
- Headless environments
- Multiple concurrent sessions

Use **OAuth** for:
- Web applications
- First-time setup in Claude/ChatGPT
- When you want automatic token refresh

---

## Troubleshooting

### Key Not Working

1. Verify the key is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
2. Check the key hasn't been revoked
3. Check the key hasn't expired
4. Ensure the Authorization header format is correct: `Bearer bmc_...`

### "Unauthorized" Error

1. Confirm your subscription is active
2. Verify the key belongs to your account
3. Try creating a new key

### Key Not Showing in List

Keys are only shown once at creation. If you lost the key:
1. Revoke the old key
2. Create a new one
3. Update your configuration
