## Setup with Claude

Basic Memory Cloud uses Remote MCP to connect to AI assistants. The connection URL is:

```
https://cloud.basicmemory.com/mcp
```

::steps
### Open Claude Settings

In Claude Web or Desktop, go to **Settings → Claude → Connectors**

### Add Custom Connector

Click **Add custom connector** and enter:
- **Name**: Basic Memory
- **Remote MCP server URL**: `https://cloud.basicmemory.com/mcp`

Click **Add**

### Authenticate

Click **Connect** to authenticate and grant permissions to Claude.

This opens an OAuth flow to authorize Claude to access your Basic Memory Cloud account.

### Configure Tools (Optional)

Click **Configure** to customize which tools are enabled. You can enable or disable specific tools and configure permissions.

### Verify Setup

Confirm Basic Memory is available in the "search and tools" menu for a chat. All your notes will be saved to your cloud instance.

## Setup with ChatGPT

::note
ChatGPT requires a **Pro or Max subscription** to use Remote MCP servers.
::

For detailed ChatGPT setup instructions, see the [ChatGPT Integration](/integrations/chatgpt) guide.

---

Edit and manage your cloud notes directly in your browser at [app.basicmemory.com/notes](https://app.basicmemory.com/notes).

**Key features:**
- **View and Edit Notes** - Browse and edit with a rich markdown editor
- **Import Conversations** - Import ChatGPT, Claude, or JSON data
- **Manage Projects** - Create, switch between, and manage projects
- **Upload Files** - Bulk upload markdown files and directories

::tip
For the complete web app guide including detailed instructions for editing, importing, and project management, see the [Web App Guide](/cloud/web-app).
::

## Command Line Tools

The CLI tools are **optional** but enable advanced features like project management, file upload, and bidirectional sync.

**Requirements**: Basic Memory CLI v0.16.0 or later. See [Getting Started](/start-here/getting-started) for installation.

::note{icon="i-lucide-info"}
**Why use the CLI?**
- Manage multiple projects from terminal
- Upload entire folders to cloud
- Set up bidirectional sync with local files
- Automate workflows with scripts
::

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Authenticate
bm cloud login

# 2. Check Status
bm cloud status

# 3. List Projects
bm project list
```

### Authentication

Basic Memory uses JWT-based cloud authentication with OAuth 2.1 and automatic subscription validation.

#### Login to Cloud

```bash
bm cloud login
```

**What happens:**
1. Opens browser to OAuth authorization page
2. Handles PKCE challenge/response automatically
3. Validates active subscription status
4. Stores JWT token in `~/.basic-memory/basic-memory-cloud.json`
5. Token automatically refreshed when needed

A confirmation code will be displayed in both the browser and terminal. Confirm the codes match and press the **Confirm** button on the web page.

After login:
```
✅ Successfully authenticated with Basic Memory Cloud!
Verifying subscription access...
✓ Cloud mode enabled
All CLI commands now work against https://cloud.basicmemory.com
✓ Tokens saved to ~/.basic-memory/basic-memory-cloud.json
```

::note{icon="i-lucide-info"}
After `bm cloud login`, CLI tools access cloud endpoints instead of local MCP. Commands like `bm project list` show cloud projects, and `bm tool [name]` invokes tools in the cloud.
::

**If no subscription:**
```
Active subscription required
Subscribe at: https://basicmemory.com/subscribe
```

#### Check Status

```bash
bm cloud status
```

Shows: authentication status, subscription status, last sync time, cloud project count, tenant information, and sync directory configuration.

#### Logout

```bash
bm cloud logout
```

Removes `~/.basic-memory/basic-memory-cloud.json` and clears cached credentials.

### Project Management

```bash
# Create a new cloud project
bm project add my-new-project

# Create and set as default
bm project add my-new-project --default

# List all cloud projects
bm project list
```

Example output:
```
           Basic Memory Projects
┏━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Name ┃ Path                   ┃ Default ┃
┡━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━┩
│ main │ /app/data/basic-memory │ ✓       │
└──────┴────────────────────────┴─────────┘
```

::tip
For more project management commands, see `bm project --help` or the [CLI Reference](/reference/cli-reference).
::

---

## Upload Files to Cloud

Upload local files or directories to cloud projects using `bm cloud upload`:

```bash
# Upload a directory to existing project
bm cloud upload ~/my-notes --project research

# Upload a single file
bm cloud upload important-doc.md --project research

# Upload and create project in one step
bm cloud upload ~/local-project --project new-research --create-project

# Upload without triggering sync
bm cloud upload ~/bulk-data --project archives --no-sync
```

**File Filtering:** The upload command respects `.bmignore` and `.gitignore` patterns, automatically excluding:
- Hidden files (`.git`, `.DS_Store`)
- Build artifacts (`node_modules`, `__pycache__`)
- Database files (`*.db`, `*.db-wal`)
- Environment files (`.env`)

**Complete Example:**
```bash
# 1. Login to cloud
bm cloud login

# 2. Upload local project (creates project if needed)
bm cloud upload ~/specs --project specs --create-project

# 3. Verify upload
bm project list
```

After sync completes, the notes are available in the [Notes Web Editor](https://app.basicmemory.com) and for AI conversations.

::tip
For bidirectional sync (editing both locally and in cloud), see the [Cloud Sync Guide](/cloud/cloud-sync).
::

## Cloud Snapshots

Basic Memory Cloud includes point-in-time snapshots for backup and recovery. Create manual snapshots before major changes, or rely on automatic daily backups.

**Key features:**
- Create unlimited manual snapshots
- Automatic daily snapshots
- Browse historical versions
- Restore individual files or folders

```bash
# Create a snapshot before major changes
bm cloud snapshot create "Before reorganization"

# List all snapshots
bm cloud snapshot list

# Browse and restore files
bm cloud snapshot browse snap_abc123
```

::tip
For complete snapshot management including restore procedures and best practices, see the [Cloud Snapshots Guide](/cloud/cloud-snapshots).
::

## Migrating to Cloud

Already using Basic Memory locally? You have two options:

### Option 1: One-Time Upload (Fastest)

Upload your existing local project to cloud:

```bash
# Login first
bm cloud login

# Upload entire project
bm cloud upload ~/basic-memory --project main --create-project
```

**Use when:**
- You want to move to cloud-only
- One-time migration is sufficient
- Don't need ongoing local-cloud sync

### Option 2: Bidirectional Sync (Hybrid Workflow)

Set up sync to work both locally and in cloud:

```bash
# Login and setup sync
bm cloud login
bm cloud setup

# Add existing project with sync enabled
bm project add main --local-path ~/basic-memory

# Initial sync (resync creates baseline)
bm project bisync --name main --resync --dry-run  # preview first
bm project bisync --name main --resync             # establish baseline

# Ongoing sync (run after local or cloud changes)
bm project bisync --name main
```

**Use when:**
- You want to edit both locally (Obsidian, VS Code) and in cloud
- Need offline access
- Want automatic bidirectional sync

::note{icon="i-lucide-info"}
Both methods preserve all your notes, relations, and tags. Choose based on whether you want cloud-only or hybrid local+cloud workflow. See the [Cloud Sync Guide](/cloud/cloud-sync) for detailed sync configuration.
