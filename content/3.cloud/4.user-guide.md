## Basic Memory Workflow

Using Basic Memory follows a natural cycle:

::mermaid
---
code: |
  flowchart LR
      A[Conversation] --> B[Capture]
      B --> C[Connect]
      C --> D[Reference]
      D --> E[Edit]
      E --> A
---
::

1. **Have conversations** with AI assistants like Claude
2. **Capture knowledge** as notes in your cloud storage
3. **Build connections** between pieces of knowledge
4. **Reference your knowledge** in future conversations
5. **Edit notes** in the web app when needed

---

## Creating Knowledge

### Through Conversations

The most natural way to create knowledge is during conversations:

```bash
You: We've covered several authentication approaches. Could you create a note
     summarizing what we've discussed?

Claude: I'll create a note summarizing our authentication discussion.

[Uses write_note tool]

Done! I've created "Authentication Approaches.md" with:
- Overview of options we discussed
- Observations about JWT vs sessions
- Relations to your security notes
```

This creates a Markdown file with semantic markup in your cloud knowledge base.

### Through the Web App

You can also create notes directly in the [web app](https://app.basicmemory.com/notes):

1. Navigate to **Notes** in the web app
2. Click **New Note** or create in a specific folder
3. Add frontmatter with title and optional tags
4. Structure content with observations and relations
5. Save - changes sync automatically

**Example note structure:**
```bash
---
title: API Design Decisions
tags: [api, architecture, decisions]
---

# API Design Decisions

## Context
We needed to choose an approach for the new API.

## Observations
- [decision] Use REST over GraphQL for simplicity #api
- [requirement] Must support versioning from day one
- [risk] Rate limiting needed for public endpoints

## Relations
- implements [[API Specification]]
- depends_on [[Authentication System]]
```

---

## Using Special Prompts

Basic Memory includes special prompts that help you leverage your knowledge base effectively.

### Continue Conversation

Resume previous topics with full context:

```bash
"Let's continue our conversation about [topic]"
```

**What happens:**
- Searches your knowledge base for relevant content
- Builds context from related documents
- Resumes with awareness of previous discussions

### Recent Activity

See what you've been working on:

```bash
"What have we been discussing recently?"
```

**What happens:**
- Retrieves recently modified documents
- Summarizes main topics and points
- Offers to continue any discussions

### Search

Find specific information:

```bash
"Find information about [topic]"
```

**What happens:**
- Searches across all your documents
- Summarizes key findings
- Offers to explore specific documents

---

## Working with Memory URLs

Basic Memory uses special `memory://` URLs to reference knowledge:

### URL Formats

```bash
memory://title                   # Reference by title
memory://folder/title            # Reference by folder and title
memory://permalink               # Reference by permalink
memory://path/relation_type/*    # Follow all relations of type
```

### Using Memory URLs

Reference existing knowledge in conversations:

```bash
You: "Take a look at memory://coffee-brewing-methods and let's discuss improvements"
```

Claude will load that specific document and any related context.

::tip
Memory URLs are stable identifiers. Even if you rename or move a file, the permalink stays the same.
::

---

## Building Knowledge Connections

### Creating Relations

Use WikiLink syntax to connect knowledge:

```bash
## Relations
- implements [[Authentication System]]
- requires [[Database Schema]]
- relates_to [[Security Guidelines]]
```

### Common Relation Types

| Type | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `implements` | One thing implements another |
| `requires` | Dependencies |
| `relates_to` | General connections |
| `part_of` | Hierarchy relationships |
| `extends` | Extensions or enhancements |
| `pairs_with` | Things that work together |
| `inspired_by` | Source of ideas |
| `replaces` | Supersedes another document |

### Adding Observations

Structure facts with semantic categories:

```bash
## Observations
- [decision] We chose JWT tokens for stateless auth
- [requirement] Must support 2FA for sensitive operations
- [technique] Use bcrypt for password hashing
- [issue] Rate limiting needed for login attempts
- [fact] Average response time is 50ms
- [question] Should we support OAuth?
```

---

## Multi-Project Workflows

### How Projects Work

Basic Memory Cloud supports multiple projects for organizing different knowledge bases. When you start a conversation, the AI will:

1. Check your available projects
2. Suggest the most active project based on recent activity
3. Ask which project to use for this conversation
4. Remember your choice throughout the session

**Example conversation:**
```bash
You: "Let's work on documentation"

Claude: I see you have 3 projects: main, work-notes, personal
Your most active project is work-notes.
Should I use work-notes for this task?

You: "Yes, let's use work-notes"

Claude: I'll use the 'work-notes' project for our session.
```

### Managing Projects in Web App

In the [web app](https://app.basicmemory.com/notes):

1. Use the **Project dropdown** in the upper left to switch projects
2. Click **Manage Projects** to create, rename, or delete projects
3. Use the **more menu** (...) on any project to upload files or download archives

---

## Organizing Your Knowledge

### Folder Structure

Organize notes in any structure that suits you:

```bash
main/
├── projects/          # Active project notes
│   ├── api-redesign/
│   └── mobile-app/
├── decisions/         # Decision records
├── learning/          # Research and learning notes
├── meetings/          # Meeting notes
└── archive/           # Completed/old content
```

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive filenames
- Group related content in folders
- Include dates in time-sensitive notes (e.g., `2024-01-15 Team Standup.md`)
- Archive old content regularly

### Moving and Organizing

In the web app, you can drag and drop notes between folders. Or ask your AI:

```bash
You: "Move my old meeting notes to the archive folder"

Claude: [Uses move_note]
"Done! I've moved 12 meeting notes to the archive folder."
```

---

## Editing Notes

### In the Web App

The web app provides a live Markdown editor:

1. Click any note to open it
2. Edit directly in the editor pane
3. Changes save automatically
4. Preview renders in real-time

### Through AI

Ask your AI to make changes:

```bash
You: "Add a troubleshooting section to my setup guide"

Claude: [Uses edit_note with append operation]
"I've added a troubleshooting section to the end of your setup guide."
```

**Available operations:**
- `append` - Add content to end
- `prepend` - Add content to beginning
- `find_replace` - Replace specific text
- `replace_section` - Replace entire section by heading

### Directory Operations

Move or delete entire folders:

```bash
You: "Move the old-projects folder to archive"

Claude: [Uses move_note with is_directory=true]
"Moved old-projects/ → archive/old-projects/ (15 files)"
```

---

## Importing Data

### From Claude or ChatGPT

Import your conversation history:

1. In the web app, go to **Settings → Import Data**
2. Select import type (Claude or ChatGPT)
3. Choose target project and destination folder
4. Upload your export file

::tip
Imported conversations are converted to Basic Memory's markdown format with observations and relations extracted automatically.
::

### From Files

Upload existing markdown files:

1. In the web app, click **Manage Projects**
2. Click the **more menu** (...) on your project
3. Select **Upload** and choose files or folders

---

## Snapshots and Backup

Basic Memory Cloud automatically creates daily snapshots. You can also create manual snapshots before major changes.

### Creating Snapshots

In the web app or via CLI:

```bash
bm cloud snapshot create "Before reorganization"
```

### Restoring from Snapshots

1. List available snapshots
2. Browse snapshot contents
3. Download and restore individual files as needed

See the [Cloud Guide](/cloud/cloud-guide#cloud-snapshots) for detailed snapshot management.

---

## Best Practices

### Knowledge Creation

1. **Create relations** - Link related concepts with `[[WikiLinks]]`
2. **Make observations** - Structure facts with `[category]` syntax
3. **Be descriptive** - Use clear titles and rich content
4. **Add context** - Include background and reasoning
5. **Review and refine** - Edit AI-generated content for accuracy

### Workflow

1. **Use special prompts** - "Continue conversation", "Recent activity", "Search"
2. **Build incrementally** - Add to existing notes rather than creating duplicates
3. **Organize regularly** - Move old content to archive
4. **Cross-reference** - Link new content to existing knowledge
5. **Use projects** - Separate work, personal, research

### Long-term Maintenance

1. **Archive old content** - Keep active knowledge base focused
2. **Refactor connections** - Update relations as knowledge evolves
3. **Regular reviews** - Periodically update key documents
4. **Use snapshots** - Create snapshots before major reorganizations

---

## Local Sync (Optional)

Want to edit files locally with Obsidian or VS Code? Set up bidirectional sync:

```bash
bm cloud login
bm cloud setup
bm project bisync --name main
```

This syncs your cloud notes to a local folder. Changes in either location sync automatically.

See the [Cloud Sync Guide](/cloud/cloud-sync) for detailed setup.

---

## Troubleshooting

### AI Can't Find Knowledge

1. Confirm you're connected to the correct project
2. Check that the note exists in the web app
3. Use `memory://` URLs for direct references
4. Try searching with different terms

### Web App Issues

1. Refresh the page
2. Check your subscription status
3. Clear browser cache if notes aren't updating
4. Try a different browser

### Sync Issues

If using local sync:
1. Check sync status: `bm cloud status`
2. Run manual sync: `bm project bisync --name main`
3. Check for conflicts in the sync log
