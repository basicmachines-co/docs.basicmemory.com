### Cloud Snapshots

Basic Memory Cloud now includes point-in-time snapshots for backup and recovery. Create manual snapshots before major changes, or rely on automatic daily backups.

### View Snapshots

Go to **Settings → Snapshots** to see all snapshots with creation time and description.

### Create a Snapshot

1. Click **Create Snapshot**
2. Add an optional description (e.g., "Before reorganizing projects")
3. Confirm

![Create snapshot](/screenshots/cloud-app/create-snapshot.png)

You can create and manage point-in-time snapshots of your cloud bucket from the cli also:

```bash
# Create a snapshot before major changes
bm cloud snapshot create "Before reorganization"

# List all snapshots
bm cloud snapshot list

# Browse snapshot contents
bm cloud snapshot browse <snapshot-id>

# Show snapshot details
bm cloud snapshot show <snapshot-id>
```

Snapshots provide a safety net for major reorganizations or experiments with your knowledge base.
