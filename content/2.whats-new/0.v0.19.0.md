title: v0.19.0
description: Schema system, semantic search, per-project routing, and more in Basic Memory v0.19.0.
---

v0.19.0 is a major release that introduces schema-driven note workflows, production-ready semantic search, and per-project cloud routing. These features work together to make your knowledge base more structured, more discoverable, and more flexible in how it connects to cloud and local storage.

---

## Schema System

Knowledge bases grow organically, and over time note structure drifts — some `person` notes have a `[name]` observation, others use `[full_name]`, and relation types vary between `works_at` and `employed_by`. The new schema system gives you a way to define what "consistent" means for each note type, check your notes against that definition, and track how patterns evolve.

The workflow is conversational — just ask your AI assistant:

```
You: "I've been writing a lot of person notes. Can you figure out
      what they have in common and create a schema?"

Claude: [Analyzes your person notes, creates a schema note]

Done! I created a Person schema based on your 45 person notes.
"name" is required, "role" and "works_at" are optional.

You: "How do my existing notes look against that?"

Claude: [Validates all person notes]

42 of 45 pass. Three are missing the [name] observation.
Want me to fix those?
```

The schema itself is just a regular note with `type: schema`:

```yaml
---
title: Person
type: schema
entity: person
version: 1
schema:
  name: string, full name
  role?: string, job title
  works_at?: Organization, employer
  expertise?(array): string, areas of knowledge
settings:
  validation: warn
---
```

Schemas don't stop notes from being written — they give the AI an extra capability to check its own work and follow your preferred patterns. When a schema exists for a note type, the AI uses it as a creation guide automatically.

See the full [Schema System](/concepts/schema-system) guide for syntax, resolution rules, and workflows.

## Semantic Search

When semantic dependencies are installed, Basic Memory automatically uses hybrid search — combining keyword matching with meaning-based retrieval. Search for "login security improvements" and find notes about "authentication hardening" even though the exact words don't match.

Three search modes are available:

- **`hybrid`** (default when semantic deps installed) — Combines keyword and semantic search with rank fusion
- **`text`** — Keyword-only search (the fallback without semantic deps)
- **`vector`** — Pure semantic similarity search

```python
# Hybrid is the default — just search normally
search_notes(query="authentication security")

# Pure meaning-based search
search_notes(query="how to speed up the app", search_type="vector")

# Per-query similarity threshold
search_notes(query="error handling", search_type="hybrid", min_similarity=0.7)
```

Semantic dependencies are included in Homebrew installs. For uv, install with extras:

```bash
uv tool install 'basic-memory[semantic]'
bm reindex --embeddings
```

Vector and hybrid search return observation-level results — individual facts and relations, not just whole notes — so you find the specific piece of information you need.

See the full [Semantic Search](/concepts/semantic-search) guide for configuration, embedding providers, and how it works under the hood.

## Per-Project Local/Cloud Routing

You can now route individual projects through cloud while keeping others local. The stdio MCP server only calls local projects, while cloud projects are available via CLI commands.

```bash
# Save or create a cloud API key
bm cloud set-key bmc_...
bm cloud create-key "my-laptop"

# Route a specific project through cloud
bm project set-cloud research

# Revert to local routing
bm project set-local research
```

The routing model has three levels:
1. **Global** — `bm cloud login` sends all commands to cloud by default
2. **Per-project** — `bm project set-cloud/set-local` overrides for specific projects
3. **Per-command** — `--local` / `--cloud` flags provide one-off overrides

---

## Project-Prefixed Permalinks

Memory URLs now support project scoping for multi-project disambiguation. When `permalinks_include_project` is enabled (the default), generated permalinks include the project slug:

```text
memory://main/docs/authentication
memory://research/specs/search-ranking
```

This makes cross-project references unambiguous. Within notes, the `project::note-path` syntax is normalized to `project/note-path` for consistent resolution.

---

## Output Format Improvements

`search_notes` and `read_note` now support an `output_format` parameter:

- **`default`** — Structured data (for programmatic use)
- **`ascii`** — Plain text table (for terminal display)
- **`ansi`** — Colorized terminal output

---

## `write_note` Metadata

`write_note` now accepts `note_type` and `metadata` parameters for richer frontmatter control:

```python
await write_note(
    title="Sprint Planning 2026-02-15",
    content="...",
    directory="meetings",
    note_type="meeting",
    metadata={"sprint": 12, "team": "backend", "status": "completed"},
    project="main"
)
```

The `note_type` sets the `type` frontmatter field (used for schema resolution and filtering). The `metadata` parameter accepts any key-value pairs that get merged into the note's YAML header.

---

## `bm watch` Command

A new standalone watch command runs the file watcher as a dedicated long-running process:

```bash
bm watch
bm watch --project main
```

Use this when you're editing notes in an external editor (Obsidian, VS Code, etc.) and want the database index updated in real-time without running the full MCP server.

---

## Upgrade Notes

### Project config migration

Project configuration now uses structured entries with `path`, `mode`, and sync metadata. Legacy config formats (string-valued `projects`, `project_modes`, `cloud_projects`) are migrated automatically when Basic Memory loads your config. The migrated config is re-saved in the new format.

### `default_project_mode` removal

The `default_project_mode` setting is no longer used. `default_project` is the fallback when no project is explicitly passed to a tool or command.

### Semantic extras

Semantic search dependencies are optional extras. Install them explicitly if you want vector or hybrid search:

```bash
uv tool install 'basic-memory[semantic]'
```

### Config cleanup

Legacy configuration keys (`project_modes`, `cloud_projects`, `default_project_mode`) are migrated automatically and can be safely removed from your config file.
