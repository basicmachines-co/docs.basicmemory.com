## 3. Verify the connection

Ask your assistant:

```bash
List my basic memory projects
```

**Expected response:**
```bash
You have 1 project:
- main (default) - /app/data/basic-memory - 0 notes
```

![Claude - Project list response](/screenshots/claude/project-list-response.png)

::warning
If you get an error, check the [Troubleshooting](/reference/troubleshooting) guide.
::

---

## 4. Create your first note

Try this prompt:

```bash
Create a note called "Getting Started" with a summary of what Basic Memory does.
```

Your assistant will use the `write_note` tool to create a Markdown file in your cloud storage.

**Example conversation:**
```bash
You: Create a note called "Getting Started" with a summary of what Basic Memory does.

AI: I'll create a note summarizing Basic Memory for you.

[Uses write_note tool]

I've created "Getting Started" in your knowledge base. The note covers:
- What Basic Memory is
- How the knowledge format works
- Key features like semantic search and relations
```

## 5. View your notes

Open [app.basicmemory.com/notes](https://app.basicmemory.com/notes) to see your new note.

![Web app - First note](/screenshots/cloud-app/first-note.png)

**What you can do in the web app:**
- Browse all your notes in the folder tree
- Edit notes with the live Markdown editor
- Search across your knowledge base
- Import existing data from Claude, ChatGPT, or files
- Manage multiple projects
- Create snapshots for backup

---

## What you can do now

Try these prompts with your assistant:

| Prompt | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `Create a note about [topic]` | Creates a new note with semantic structure |
| `What have we discussed recently?` | Shows recently modified notes |
| `Find notes about [topic]` | Searches your knowledge base |
| `Continue our conversation about [topic]` | Loads context from previous notes |
| `Add to my notes about [topic]` | Edits an existing note |
| `Show me my notes on [topic]` | Displays a formatted note |

### Example workflow

```bash
You: "I've been researching coffee brewing methods. Create a note about pour-over technique."

AI: [Creates note with observations and tags]

--- Later ---

You: "What do I know about coffee brewing?"

Claude: [Searches knowledge base, finds your pour-over note]
"Based on your notes, you've been exploring pour-over techniques..."

You: "Add a section about water temperature to my coffee notes"

Claude: [Uses edit_note to append new content]
```
