Local mode keeps notes on your machine and runs the MCP server locally. It's open-source and free to use.

## 1. Install Basic Memory

Choose your installation method. The default install includes semantic search dependencies for hybrid (keyword + meaning-based) search.

### macOS (Homebrew) - Recommended

```bash
brew tap basicmachines-co/basic-memory
brew install basic-memory
```

Homebrew includes semantic search dependencies automatically.

### All platforms (uv)

First install `uv` from [astral.sh](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), then:

```bash
uv tool install 'basic-memory[semantic]'
```

::note
**Requirements:** Python 3.13 or higher. Check with `python --version`.
::

### Lightweight install (without semantic search)

If you don't need hybrid search or want a smaller install:

```bash
uv tool install basic-memory
```

Search will use keyword-only mode. You can add semantic search later with `uv tool upgrade 'basic-memory[semantic]'`.

### Verify installation

```bash
basic-memory --version
```

**Expected output:**
```bash
basic-memory, version 0.18.x
```

## 2. Configure Claude Desktop

Edit your Claude Desktop config file:

| Platform | Config Location |
|----------|-----------------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Linux | `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |

Add this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["basic-memory", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

::warning
**ENOENT error?** Use the full path to uvx. Find it with `which uvx` and replace `"uvx"` with the full path (e.g., `"/Users/yourname/.local/bin/uvx"`).
::

**Restart Claude Desktop** after editing the config.

## 3. Verify the connection

In Claude Desktop, click the **tools icon** (hammer) in the bottom-right of the chat interface. You should see Basic Memory tools listed.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot - Claude tools menu showing Basic Memory -->
![Claude - Tools menu with Basic Memory](/screenshots/claude/tools-menu-local.png)

Ask Claude:

```bash
List my projects
```

**Expected response:**
```bash
You have 1 project:
- main (default) - ~/basic-memory - 0 notes
```

<!-- TODO: Screenshot - Claude project list response -->
![Claude - Project list](/screenshots/claude/project-list-local.png)

---

## 4. Create your first note

Try this prompt:

```bash
Create a note called "Getting Started" with a summary of what Basic Memory does.
```

Claude will create a Markdown file at `~/basic-memory/Getting Started.md`.

**Example conversation:**
```bash
You: Create a note called "Getting Started" with a summary of what Basic Memory does.

Claude: I'll create a note for you.

[Uses write_note tool]

Done! I've created "Getting Started.md" in your basic-memory folder.
It includes an overview of Basic Memory's key features:
- Knowledge storage in Markdown
- Semantic observations and relations
- Search across your knowledge base
```

![Claude - Creating first note](/screenshots/claude/create-note-local.png)

---

## 5. View your notes

Your notes are stored at `~/basic-memory` by default. You can:

### Open in any text editor

```bash
# View in terminal
cat ~/basic-memory/Getting\ Started.md

# Open folder
open ~/basic-memory  # macOS
explorer ~/basic-memory  # Windows
```

### Use Obsidian for visual navigation

1. Open Obsidian
2. **Create new vault** → select `~/basic-memory`
3. Use the **graph view** to see connections between notes

<!-- TODO: Screenshot - Obsidian with Basic Memory vault and graph view -->
![Obsidian - Basic Memory vault with graph](/screenshots/obsidian/vault-with-graph.png)

### Example note structure

After creating a few notes, your folder might look like:

```bash
~/basic-memory/
├── Getting Started.md
├── projects/
│   └── API Design.md
├── research/
│   └── Database Optimization.md
└── meetings/
    └── Team Standup 2024-01-15.md
```

## What you can do now

Try these prompts with Claude:

| Prompt | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `Create a note about [topic]` | Creates a new Markdown file |
| `What have we discussed recently?` | Shows recently modified notes |
| `Find notes about [topic]` | Searches your knowledge base |
| `Continue our conversation about [topic]` | Loads context from previous notes |
| `Add to my [topic] notes` | Edits an existing note |
| `Move my [note] to the archive folder` | Reorganizes files |

### Example workflow

```bash
You: "Let's document our API design decisions"

Claude: I'll create a note for the API design decisions.
[Creates ~/basic-memory/API Design Decisions.md]

--- Later ---

You: "What did we decide about authentication?"

Claude: [Searches knowledge base]
"Based on your 'API Design Decisions' note, you decided to use JWT tokens..."

You: "Add a section about rate limiting"

Claude: [Uses edit_note to append]
"I've added a rate limiting section to your API design notes."
```

---

## Customize your setup

### Change where notes are saved

```bash
# Create a new project in a different location
basic-memory project add "my-notes" ~/Documents/notes

# Make it the default
basic-memory project default "my-notes"
```

Restart Claude Desktop for changes to take effect.

### Skip project selection prompts

If you only use one project, add to `~/.basic-memory/config.json`:

```json
{
  "default_project": "main"
}
```

---

## Useful CLI commands

```bash
# Check sync status
basic-memory status

# List all projects
basic-memory project list

# View project statistics
basic-memory project info

# Import Claude conversations
basic-memory import claude conversations

# Import ChatGPT conversations
basic-memory import chatgpt

# Force re-sync all files
basic-memory sync
```

## Troubleshooting

### ENOENT error

Claude Desktop can't find `uvx`. Use the full path:

```bash
# Find the path
which uvx
# Output: /Users/yourname/.local/bin/uvx

# Update config to use full path
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "/Users/yourname/.local/bin/uvx",
      "args": ["basic-memory", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### No tools showing

1. Verify installation: `basic-memory --version`
2. Check the config file syntax (valid JSON)
3. Restart Claude Desktop completely

### Permission errors

```bash
# Fix permissions on the notes folder
chmod -R u+rw ~/basic-memory
```

See the full [Troubleshooting](/reference/troubleshooting) guide for more solutions.
