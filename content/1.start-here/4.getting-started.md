## Choosing Where Notes Are Saved

By default, Basic Memory saves notes in a project called `main` in `~/basic-memory`. To save notes elsewhere:

### Use Your Existing Notes Folder

Ask your AI assistant directly:

```bash
Create a new project called "my project" in the "/Users/yourname/Documents/Notes" directory
```

Then:

```bash
Set the default project to "my project"
```

Or use the command line:

```bash
# Point Basic Memory to your existing notes folder
basic-memory project add "my project" <path to your project>

# Make it your default location
basic-memory project default "my project"
```

::warning
If you change default projects from the command line, new notes will be saved in your chosen folder after restarting Claude Desktop.

**Want to use Obsidian?** Just open your folder location as a vault. See the [Obsidian Integration](/integrations/obsidian) guide.

::note
**Advanced configuration**: Basic Memory stores its settings in `~/.basic-memory/config.json`. While CLI commands are recommended for configuration, you can edit this file directly. Changes require restarting Claude Desktop.

## Multi-Project Setup

Basic Memory supports multiple projects for organizing different knowledge bases (work, personal, research, etc.).

**How it works:**

When you start a conversation, the AI will:
1. Check your available projects
2. Suggest the most active project based on recent activity
3. Ask which project to use for this conversation
4. Remember your choice throughout the session

**Example:**
```bash
You: "Let's work on documentation"

Claude: I see you have 3 projects: main, work-notes, personal
Your most active project is work-notes
Should I use work-notes for this task?

You: "Yes, let's use work-notes"
```

**Creating projects:**
```bash
# Command line
basic-memory project add "work-notes" ~/Documents/work

# Or ask your AI assistant
You: "Create a new project called 'work-notes' in ~/Documents/work"
```

**For users who primarily work in one project:**

Set a default fallback project in `~/.basic-memory/config.json`:

```json
{
  "default_project": "main"
}
```

With this set, the AI uses your default project when no project is specified.

## Staying Updated

To update Basic Memory when new versions are released:

```bash
# Update with uv
uv tool upgrade basic-memory

# Or Homebrew
brew upgrade basic-memory
```

::note
After updating, restart Claude Desktop for changes to take effect.
