description: Technical details about Basic Memory implementation, architecture, licensing, and Model Context Protocol integration
---

::note
This page describes the architecture of the open-source [Basic Memory](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory) project. [Basic Memory Cloud](/cloud) builds on this foundation with hosted infrastructure and additional features.
::

## Architecture

Basic Memory consists of:

- **Core Knowledge Engine** — Parses and indexes Markdown files
- **Database** — Provides fast querying and search
- **MCP Server** — Implements the Model Context Protocol
- **CLI Tools** — Command-line utilities for management
- **File Watcher** — Monitors file changes and indexes the database

::note
  The system follows a **file-first architecture** where all knowledge is represented in standard Markdown files and the database serves as a secondary index.
::

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Basic Memory implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/spec), an open standard for enabling AI models to access external tools:

- **Standardized Interface** — Common protocol for tool integration
- **Tool Registration** — Basic Memory registers as a tool provider
- **Asynchronous Communication** — Enables efficient interaction with AI models
- **Standardized Schema** — Structured data exchange format

Integration with Claude Desktop uses the MCP to grant Claude access to your knowledge base through a set of specialized tools that search, read, and write knowledge.

## Licensing

Basic Memory is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html):

- **Free Software** — You can use, study, share, and modify the software
- **Copyleft** — Derivative works must be distributed under the same license
- **Network Use** — Network users must be able to receive the source code
- **Commercial Use** — Allowed, subject to license requirements

::note
  The AGPL license ensures Basic Memory remains open source while protecting against proprietary forks.
::

## Source Code

Basic Memory is developed as an open-source project:

- **GitHub Repository** — [https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory)
- **Issue Tracker** — Report bugs and request features on GitHub
- **Contributions** — Pull requests are welcome following the contributing guidelines
- **Documentation** — Source for this documentation is also available in the repository

## Data Storage and Privacy

Basic Memory is designed with privacy as a core principle:

::note
  **Privacy-First Design:**
  - **Local-First**: All data remains on your machine
  - **No Cloud Dependency**: No remote servers or accounts required
  - **Telemetry**: Optional and disabled by default
  - **Standard Formats**: All data is stored in standard file formats you control
::

## Implementation Details

Knowledge in Basic Memory is organized as a semantic graph:

::steps
### Entities
Distinct concepts represented by Markdown documents

### Observations
Categorized facts and information about entities

### Relations
Connections between entities that form the knowledge graph

::

This structure emerges from simple text patterns in standard Markdown:

### Example Markdown Input

```bash

- '#brewing'

# Coffee Brewing Methods

An exploration of different coffee brewing techniques, their characteristics, and how they affect flavor extraction.

## Overview

Coffee brewing is both an art and a science. Different brewing methods extract different compounds from coffee beans,
resulting in unique flavor profiles, body, and mouthfeel. The key variables in any brewing method are:

- Grind size
- Water temperature
- Brew time
- Coffee-to-water ratio
- Agitation/turbulence

## Observations

- [principle] Coffee extraction follows a predictable pattern: acids extract first, then sugars, then bitter compounds
#extraction
- [method] Pour over methods generally produce cleaner, brighter cups with more distinct flavor notes #clarity

## Relations

- requires [[Proper Grinding Technique]]
- affects [[Flavor Extraction]]
```

Basic Memory understands how to build context via its semantic graph.

### Entity Model

Basic Memory's core data model consists of:

- **Entities** — Documents in your knowledge base
- **Observations** — Facts or statements about entities
- **Relations** — Connections between entities
- **Tags** — Additional categorization for entities and observations

The system parses Markdown files to extract this structured information while preserving the human-readable format.

### Files as Source of Truth

Plain Markdown files store all knowledge, making it accessible with any text editor and easy to version with git.

### Database

The database maintains the knowledge graph topology for fast queries and semantic traversal. It contains:

- **Knowledge Graph Schema** — Database tables for the knowledge graph structure
- **Search Index** — Full text search index across the knowledge base

### Sync Process

The sync process:

::steps
### Detect Changes
Detects changes to files in the knowledge directory

### Parse Files
Parses modified files to extract structured data

### Update Database
Updates the database with changes

### Resolve References
Resolves forward references when new entities are created

### Update Search Index
Updates the search index for fast querying

::

### Search Engine

The search functionality:

- **Hybrid Search** — Uses a combination of full-text search and semantic matching
- **Comprehensive Indexing** — Indexes observations, relations, and content
- **Pattern Matching** — Supports wildcards and pattern matching in memory:// URLs
- **Graph Traversal** — Traverses the knowledge graph to follow relationships

::note
  Results are ranked by relevance to the query using advanced scoring algorithms.
