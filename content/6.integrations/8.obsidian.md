## Using with Basic Memory Cloud

Basic Memory Cloud enables a hybrid workflow: edit locally in Obsidian while your notes sync to the cloud.

::note
Sync requires the Basic Memory CLI. See [Local Installation](/local/local-install) for installation steps.
::

::steps
### Sign Up for Basic Memory Cloud
Create your account at [app.basicmemory.com](https://app.basicmemory.com)

### Enable Cloud Mode
Authenticate and enable cloud mode:

```bash
bm cloud login
```

This enables cloud mode and validates your subscription.

### Set Up Sync
Install rclone and configure credentials:

```bash
bm cloud setup
```

This installs rclone automatically and configures your cloud credentials.

### Create Project with Local Sync
Point Basic Memory to your Obsidian vault:

```bash
# If you have an existing vault
bm project add my-vault --local-path ~/path/to/obsidian-vault

# Or create a new project for a new vault
bm project add notes --local-path ~/Documents/notes
```

This creates the project on cloud and prepares local sync.

### Establish Sync Baseline
Preview and run the initial sync:

```bash
# Preview first (recommended)
bm project bisync --name my-vault --resync --dry-run

# If all looks good, establish baseline
bm project bisync --name my-vault --resync
```

This creates the initial sync state. Only use `--resync` for the first sync.

### Open Your Vault in Obsidian
Open your local directory as a vault in Obsidian. Continue editing locally with full graph view, plugins, and IDE features.

### Sync Changes
After editing in Obsidian or making changes in cloud (via AI assistants), run bidirectional sync:

```bash
bm project bisync --name my-vault
```

This syncs changes in both directions - edit locally or in cloud, both stay in sync.

::

::note
**Bidirectional sync**: `bisync` keeps local and cloud in sync automatically. Changes flow both ways, with newer files winning conflicts. For one-way sync options and advanced configuration, see the [Cloud Sync Guide](/cloud/cloud-sync).

## Setup

### Setting Up Obsidian with Basic Memory

You can either create a new vault for Basic Memory or configure Basic Memory to use your existing vault.

#### Option 1: Use an Existing Obsidian Vault

If you have an existing Obsidian vault where you want Basic Memory to save notes:

::steps
### Configure Basic Memory project
```bash
# Point Basic Memory to your existing vault
basic-memory project add main ~/path/to/your/obsidian-vault

# Set it as default
basic-memory project default main
```

### Restart Claude Desktop
Restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect

### Test the integration
Ask Claude to create a note - it will now appear in your existing vault

::

#### Option 2: Create a New Vault for Basic Memory

::steps
### Download Obsidian
Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

### Create a new vault
Create a new vault in Obsidian pointing to your Basic Memory directory (~/basic-memory by default)

### Enable core plugins
Enable core plugins like Graph View, Backlinks, and Tags

::

## Visualization Features

### Graph View

Obsidian's Graph View provides a visual representation of your knowledge network:

- **Node Representation** — Each document appears as a node
- **Connection Lines** — Relations appear as connections between nodes
- **Color Customization** — Colors can be customized to distinguish types
- **Filter Options** — Filters let you focus on specific aspects

::note
Local graphs show connections for individual documents, providing focused views of specific areas in your knowledge base.
::

### Backlinks

Obsidian automatically tracks references between documents:

- View all documents that reference the current one
- See the exact context of each reference
- Navigate easily through connections
- Track how concepts relate to each other

### Tag Explorer

Use tags to organize and filter content:

- View all tags in your knowledge base
- See how many documents use each tag
- Filter documents by tag combinations
- Create hierarchical tag structures

## Knowledge Elements

Basic Memory's knowledge format works natively with Obsidian:

### Wiki Links

```bash
## Relations
- implements [[Search Design]]
- depends_on [[Database Schema]]
```

::note
These display as clickable links in Obsidian and appear in the graph view.
::

### Observations with Tags

```bash
## Observations
- [tech] Using SQLite #database
- [design] Plain-text #architecture
```

Tags become searchable and filterable in Obsidian's tag pane.

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: Document Title
type: note
tags: [search, design]
---
```

Frontmatter provides metadata for Obsidian to use in search and filtering.

## Canvas Integration

Basic Memory can create [Obsidian Canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas) files:

::steps
### Ask Claude to create a visualization
```example
You: "Create a canvas showing the structure of our project components."
```

### Claude generates a .canvas file
The file is automatically created in your knowledge base

### Open the file in Obsidian
View and edit the visual representation in Obsidian

### Canvas files maintain references
Canvas files keep live references to your documents

::

## Recommended Plugins

These Obsidian plugins work especially well with Basic Memory:

- **Dataview** — Query your knowledge base programmatically
- **Kanban** — Organize tasks from knowledge files
- **Calendar** — View and navigate temporal knowledge
- **Templates** — Create consistent knowledge structures

## Workflow Suggestions

### Daily Notes

```bash
# 2024-01-21

## Progress
- Updated [[Search Design]]
- Fixed [[Bug Report 123]]

## Notes
- [idea] Better indexing #enhancement
- [todo] Update docs #documentation

## Links
- relates_to [[Current Sprint]]
- updates [[Project Status]]
```

### Project Tracking

```bash
# Current Sprint

## Tasks
- [ ] Update [[Search]]
- [ ] Fix [[Auth Bug]]

## Tags

```

## Advanced Obsidian Features

### Graph Analysis

#### Global Graph
View your entire knowledge network to identify:
- Central concepts (highly connected nodes)
- Knowledge clusters
- Isolated information
- Missing connections

#### Local Graph
Focus on specific documents to see:
- Direct connections
- Related concepts
- Knowledge pathways
- Context around ideas

### Search and Navigation

- **Quick Switcher** — Rapidly navigate between documents using Cmd/Ctrl + O
- **Global Search** — Search across all content with advanced filtering options
- **Tag Navigation** — Browse by tags and see tag hierarchies
- **Backlink Panel** — See all references to the current document

### Visual Customization

You can customize how your knowledge appears in Obsidian:

```css
/* Custom CSS for Basic Memory observations */
.observation-tech {
color: #4A90E2;
font-weight: bold;
}

.observation-design {
color: #7ED321;
font-style: italic;
}

.observation-decision {
color: #F5A623;
background: rgba(245, 166, 35, 0.1);
padding: 2px 4px;
border-radius: 3px;
}
```

## Integration Benefits

::note
**Why use Obsidian with Basic Memory?**

- **Visual Knowledge Mapping**: See the structure of your knowledge
- **Powerful Navigation**: Move through connected concepts easily
- **Rich Plugin Ecosystem**: Extend functionality with community plugins
- **Mature Editor**: Professional markdown editing with live preview
- **Local Files**: Everything stays on your machine, just like Basic Memory
::

## Tips for Effective Use

- **Consistent Tagging** — Use consistent tag patterns to enable better filtering and organization
- **Meaningful Relations** — Create meaningful relation types that help you understand connections
- **Regular Review** — Regularly review your graph to identify knowledge gaps
- **Template Usage** — Use templates for consistent document structure

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

### Links not appearing in graph
- Ensure proper WikiLink syntax: `[[Document Title]]`
- Check that referenced documents exist
- Verify frontmatter title matches link text

### Tags not showing up
- Use proper tag syntax: `#tag` or in frontmatter
- Check tag panel is enabled in Obsidian
- Ensure tags don't contain spaces (use hyphens)

### Canvas files not opening
- Update to latest Obsidian version
- Enable Canvas core plugin
- Check file permissions
