title: "Add Persistent Memory to Cursor — Context That Survives Sessions"
description: "Add persistent memory to Cursor with Basic Memory. Your AI assistant remembers your codebase, decisions, and context between sessions."
---

Cursor's AI-powered development environment integrates natively with Basic Memory through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling persistent context across coding sessions.

## Why Add Persistent Memory to Cursor?

Cursor's AI features are powerful, but context resets with every new session. Basic Memory gives Cursor a long-term memory:

- **Project knowledge that persists** — Architecture decisions, coding patterns, and conventions carry forward automatically
- **Richer context than built-in memories** — Full notes with semantic connections, not just short preference strings
- **Searchable across sessions** — Instantly find any past decision, discussion, or code insight
- **Markdown files you control** — Your knowledge lives as plain text, editable in Cursor itself

## Cloud Setup

Basic Memory Cloud provides hosted MCP access with no local installation required.

::steps
### Sign Up
Create your account at [app.basicmemory.com](https://app.basicmemory.com)

### Configure Remote MCP in Cursor
In Cursor, go to **Settings → Developer → Edit Config**

Select **MCP Tools** and click **Add Custom MCP**

Add Basic Memory Cloud configuration:
```json
{
"mcpServers": {
"basic-memory-cloud": {
"url": "https://cloud.basicmemory.com/mcp"
}
}
}
```

### Authenticate
Follow the OAuth flow to grant Cursor access to your Basic Memory account

### Verify Setup
In Cursor, ask the AI:

```
You: "What tools do you have access to?"
```

You should see Basic Memory tools listed

## Local Setup

### Configure MCP in Cursor

Cursor supports MCP natively! Configure Basic Memory following the [Cursor MCP documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol).

**Add to Cursor's MCP configuration:**

```json
{
"mcpServers": {
"basic-memory": {
"command": "uvx",
"args": ["basic-memory", "mcp"]
}
}
}
```

### Install Basic Memory (optional)

```bash
# Install Basic Memory
uv tool install basic-memory

# Or with pip
pip install basic-memory
```

### Verify Installation

In Cursor, check that Basic Memory tools are available by asking the AI:

```
You: "What tools do you have access to?"
```

You should see Basic Memory tools listed, including note creation, search, and project management.

## Quick Start

Once configured, you can immediately start using Basic Memory in your Cursor conversations:

```
You: "Create a Basic Memory project for this codebase in the docs folder"
Cursor: [Creates project configuration and folder structure]

You: "Document our architecture decisions as we make them"
Cursor: [Creates structured notes with observations and relations]
```

## MCP Integration Benefits

::note
Cursor's native MCP support enables Basic Memory integration with:
- Direct tool access in AI conversations
- Real-time knowledge base queries
- Persistent context across coding sessions
- No manual content transfer needed
::

### Available Tools

Through MCP, Cursor can access all Basic Memory tools:

- **write_note** - Create structured documentation
- **read_note** - Access existing knowledge
- **search_notes** - Find relevant information
- **edit_note** - Update documentation incrementally
- **recent_activity** - Check what you've been working on
- **project management** - Work with multiple knowledge bases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

### MCP tools not appearing in Cursor
**Solutions:**
- Verify Basic Memory is installed: `basic-memory --version`
- Check MCP configuration syntax in Cursor settings
- Restart Cursor after configuration changes
- Try absolute path to uvx if needed

### Tools appear but don't work
**Solutions:**
- Check Basic Memory sync status: `basic-memory status`
- Verify project directory permissions
- Ensure uvx can find basic-memory: `which basic-memory`

### Performance issues
**Solutions:**
- Large knowledge bases may slow responses
- Consider splitting into multiple projects
- Check available disk space

## Alternative Integration

If MCP setup doesn't work immediately, you can also:

- **File-Based Editing** — Edit Basic Memory notes directly in Cursor with full IDE features
- **CLI Integration** — Use Basic Memory CLI tools from Cursor's integrated terminal
- **Parallel Usage** — Use Claude Desktop alongside Cursor for knowledge management

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Cursor have memory?
Cursor has a built-in "Memories" feature for storing short preferences, but it's limited to simple rules. Basic Memory provides full knowledge management — searchable notes, semantic connections, and rich context that grows with your project.

### How do I add persistent memory to Cursor?
Configure Basic Memory as an MCP server in Cursor's settings. Go to **Settings → Developer → Edit Config**, add the MCP configuration, and restart Cursor. See the setup guide above for detailed instructions.

### Can I use Basic Memory and Cursor's built-in memories together?
Yes. Cursor's built-in memories handle quick preferences and rules. Basic Memory handles everything deeper — architecture decisions, project history, detailed technical context, and cross-session knowledge.
