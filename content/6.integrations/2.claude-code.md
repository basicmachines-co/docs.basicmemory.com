title: "Add Memory to Claude Code — Persistent Context Across Sessions"
description: "Give Claude Code persistent memory with Basic Memory. Your AI remembers decisions, code patterns, and project context across every session."
---

Claude Code provides native support for Basic Memory through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling persistent context across development sessions and building comprehensive coding knowledge.

## Why Add Memory to Claude Code?

Claude Code is powerful, but every new session starts from zero. Basic Memory changes that:

- **Persistent context** — Your AI remembers project architecture, past decisions, and coding patterns
- **Cross-session knowledge** — Pick up exactly where you left off, no re-explaining
- **Searchable history** — Find any past conversation, decision, or code review instantly
- **Plain text you own** — Everything stored as Markdown files you can read, edit, and version control

## Cloud Setup

::steps
### Sign Up
Create your account at [app.basicmemory.com](https://app.basicmemory.com)

### Add Remote MCP Server
In Claude Code, add the remote MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add -s user -t http basic-memory-cloud https://cloud.basicmemory.com/mcp
```

### Authenticate
Follow the OAuth flow in Claude Code to grant permissions

### Verify Setup
In Claude Code, check available tools:

```bash
You: "What tools do you have access to?"
```

You should see Basic Memory tools listed

::

::tip
See the [Cloud Guide](/cloud/cloud-guide) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.
::

## Local Setup

### Configure Claude Code

Install with:

```bash
claude mcp add basic-memory basic-memory mcp
```

::note
For Basic Memory installation, see [Quickstart: Local](/start-here/quickstart-local).
::

### Verify Installation

In Claude Code, check that Basic Memory tools are available:

```bash
You: "What tools do you have access to?"
```

You should see Basic Memory tools listed, including note creation, search, and project management.

## Quick Start

Once configured, you can immediately start using Basic Memory in your development workflow:

```bash
You: "Create a note about our authentication strategy for the API"
Claude: I'll document the authentication strategy we discussed...
[Creates structured note with technical details and rationale]

You: "Switch to my personal coding project"
Claude: [Changes context to personal project knowledge base]
```

## MCP Integration Benefits

Claude Code's native MCP support provides:

- **Automatic tool access** - No manual setup required
- **Project-aware context** - Maintains separate knowledge bases per project
- **Real-time sync** - Changes are immediately available
- **Persistent memory** - Context survives between sessions
- **Structured knowledge** - Uses Basic Memory's semantic format

### Available Tools

Through MCP, Claude Code can access all Basic Memory functionality:

- **write_note** - Create and update documentation
- **read_note** - Access existing knowledge and context
- **search_notes** - Find relevant information across projects
- **edit_note** - Update documentation incrementally
- **recent_activity** - Check what you've been working on
- **project management** - Switch between different knowledge bases
- **build_context** - Load conversation context from memory:// URLs

## Integration with Development

### CLAUDE.md Enhancement

Claude Code uses CLAUDE.md files for project instructions. Basic Memory complements this by:

- **Storing detailed knowledge** outside the context window
- **Enabling search** across your entire knowledge base
- **Maintaining history** of decisions and learnings
- **Linking related concepts** through relations

### Project Context

Basic Memory maintains separate knowledge bases for different projects:

```bash
You: "Switch to my work project"
Claude: [Loads work project context and knowledge]

You: "Based on our API design notes, what's the next step?"
Claude: [References existing documentation to provide contextual guidance]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Code can't access Basic Memory
**Solutions:**
- Verify Basic Memory is installed: `basic-memory --version`
- Check MCP server status: `/mcp` in Claude Code
- Reinstall if needed: `claude mcp remove basic-memory` then `claude mcp add basic-memory basic-memory mcp`

### Context not loading from memory:// URLs
**Solutions:**
- Confirm files exist in current project
- Check memory:// URL syntax (e.g., `memory://folder/note`)
- Verify sync is working: `basic-memory status`

### Notes not updating
**Solutions:**
- Check file permissions in knowledge base directory
- Check ~/.basic-memory for logs containing error messages
- Report error messages to the Basic Memory team

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Claude Code have built-in memory?
Claude Code doesn't have persistent memory between sessions by default. Basic Memory adds this capability through MCP, giving Claude Code access to your knowledge base across every session.

### How do I add memory to Claude Code?
Install Basic Memory and configure it as an MCP server: `claude mcp add basic-memory basic-memory mcp`. See the setup guide above for detailed instructions.

### Does Basic Memory work with Claude Code's CLAUDE.md?
Yes! Basic Memory complements CLAUDE.md by storing detailed knowledge outside the context window. CLAUDE.md handles project instructions; Basic Memory handles everything else — decisions, context, history.
