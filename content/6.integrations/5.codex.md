description: Set up Basic Memory with OpenAI Codex for persistent development knowledge and enhanced coding sessions
---
OpenAI Codex provides native support for Basic Memory through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling persistent context across development sessions and building comprehensive coding knowledge.

## Setup

### Video Tutorial

Watch this quick guide to get started with Basic Memory and OpenAI Codex:

### Configure Codex

Basic Memory works with Codex through MCP. Install it with:

```bash
codex mcp add basic-memory bash -c "uvx basic-memory mcp"
```
::tip
If you want to use a specific Basic Memory project, modify the command like so:
```bash
codex mcp add basic-memory bash -c "uvx basic-memory mcp --project your-project-name"
```
::
### Verify Installation

Check that Basic Memory is configured correctly:

```bash
codex mcp list
```

You should see `basic-memory` listed with the command `bash -c uvx basic-memory mcp --project main`.

## Codex CLI

The [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) supports MCP servers via configuration file. This is useful for connecting to Basic Memory Cloud.

### Prerequisites

Create an API key in the [web app](https://app.basicmemory.com) under **Settings → API Keys**. See the [API Keys guide](/cloud/api-keys) for detailed instructions.

### Configure Environment

Add your API key to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
# Basic Memory API key
export BASIC_MEMORY_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

Reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Configure Codex CLI

Add the Basic Memory server to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.basic-memory]
url = "https://cloud.basicmemory.com/mcp"
bearer_token_env_var = "BASIC_MEMORY_API_KEY"
```

Codex CLI will now connect to Basic Memory Cloud using your API key for authentication.

## Quick Start

Once configured, you can immediately start using Basic Memory in your development workflow:

```
You: "Create a note about our authentication strategy for the API"
Codex: I'll document the authentication strategy we discussed...
[Creates structured note with technical details and rationale]

You: "Switch to my personal coding project"
Codex: [Changes context to personal project knowledge base]
```

## MCP Integration Benefits

Codex's native MCP support provides:

- **Automatic tool access** - No manual setup required
- **Project-aware context** - Maintains separate knowledge bases per project
- **Real-time sync** - Changes are immediately available
- **Persistent memory** - Context survives between sessions
- **Structured knowledge** - Uses Basic Memory's semantic format

### Available Tools

Through MCP, Codex can access all Basic Memory functionality:

- **write_note** - Create and update documentation
- **read_note** - Access existing knowledge and context
- **search_notes** - Find relevant information across projects
- **edit_note** - Update documentation incrementally
- **recent_activity** - Check what you've been working on
- **project management** - Switch between different knowledge bases
- **build_context** - Load conversation context from memory:// URLs

## Integration with Development

### Project Context

Basic Memory maintains separate knowledge bases for different projects:

```
You: "Switch to my work project"
Codex: [Loads work project context and knowledge]

You: "Based on our API design notes, what's the next step?"
Codex: [References existing documentation to provide contextual guidance]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

### Codex can't access Basic Memory
**Solutions:**
- Verify Basic Memory is installed: `basic-memory --version`
- Check MCP server configuration: `codex mcp list`
- Reinstall if needed: `codex mcp remove basic-memory` then `codex mcp add basic-memory bash -c "uvx basic-memory mcp --project main"`

### Context not loading from memory:// URLs
**Solutions:**
- Confirm files exist in current project
- Check memory:// URL syntax (e.g., `memory://folder/note`)
- Verify sync is working: `basic-memory status`

### Notes not updating
**Solutions:**
- Check file permissions in knowledge base directory
- Check ~/.basic-memory for logs containing error messages
- Report error messages to the Basic Memory team

### Performance Tips

- **Multiple projects**: Use separate Basic Memory projects for different codebases
- **Organized structure**: Keep consistent folder organization across projects
- **Regular cleanup**: Archive old projects to maintain performance

## Alternative Usage

If MCP isn't working, you can still use Basic Memory:

- **CLI Integration** — Use Basic Memory CLI tools from your terminal
- **File Editing** — Edit Basic Memory notes directly and sync manually
- **Manual Context** — Copy content from Basic Memory into conversations
- **Parallel Usage** — Use Claude Desktop or other MCP clients alongside Codex. With Basic Memory they can see the same notes and share context.
