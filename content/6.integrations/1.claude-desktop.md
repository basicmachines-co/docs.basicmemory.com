description: Set up Basic Memory with Claude Desktop for persistent conversations and knowledge management
---

Claude Desktop is the recommended way to use Basic Memory. Integration through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) gives Claude direct access to your knowledge base.

## Cloud Setup

::steps
### Sign Up
Create your account at [app.basicmemory.com](https://app.basicmemory.com)

### Add Remote MCP Connector
In Claude Desktop, go to **Settings → Claude → Connectors**

Click "Add connector" and enter:
- **Name**: Basic Memory
- **Remote MCP server URL**: `https://cloud.basicmemory.com/mcp`

![Add connector](/claude-settings-add-connector.png)

### Authenticate
Click "Connect" and follow the OAuth flow to grant permissions

![Configure connector](/claude-settings-configure.png)

### Verify Setup
In Claude, click the tools icon (🔨) to see Basic Memory tools

![Tools menu](/claude-settings-tools.png)

Try Prompting: `List my projects`

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Knowledge Creation** — Create and update notes through natural conversation
- **Knowledge Search** — Find information across your entire knowledge base
- **Context Building** — Load context from previous conversations using memory:// URLs
- **Project Management** — Work with multiple knowledge projects in each conversation
- **Visual Note Display** — View notes as formatted artifacts for better readability

### Real-time Sync

Changes you make to files are immediately available in conversations:

1. Edit a file in any text editor
2. Save the changes
3. Ask Claude to read the note - it will see your updates

### Memory URLs

Reference specific knowledge with `memory://` URLs:

```bash
You: "Take a look at memory://project-planning and let's continue our discussion"
```

Claude will load that specific note and any related context.

## Common Workflows

### Creating Knowledge

**During a conversation:**
```bash
You: "Could you create a note summarizing our discussion about API design?"
Claude: I'll create a note capturing our API design discussion...
[Creates structured note with observations and relations]
```

**Building on existing knowledge:**
```bash
You: "Add a section about authentication to my API documentation"
Claude: [Uses edit_note to append new content without rewriting]
```

### Searching and Discovery

**Find information:**
```bash
You: "What did we decide about the database schema?"
Claude: [Searches knowledge base and provides relevant information]
```

**View formatted notes:**
```bash
You: "Show me the project documentation as a formatted artifact"
Claude: [Uses view_note to display the note as a readable artifact]
```

**Semantic search** (when enabled):
```bash
You: "Find notes about making the frontend faster"
Claude: [Uses hybrid search to find notes about performance optimization,
         bundle size reduction, and React rendering — even without exact keyword matches]
```

See the [Semantic Search](/concepts/semantic-search) guide for setup instructions.

**Recent activity:**
```bash
You: "What have we been working on lately?"
Claude: [Shows recently modified notes and offers to continue discussions]
```

### Project Management

Projects are selected at the start of each conversation. Claude will suggest your most active project and ask which one to use.

**For single-project users**, add this to `~/.basic-memory/config.json`:
```json
{
  "default_project": "main"
}
```

This sets a fallback project when tools do not pass `project` explicitly.

## Troubleshooting

### Claude can't find Basic Memory tools
**Solutions:**
- Verify `uv` is installed: `which uvx`
- Check config file syntax is valid JSON
- Restart Claude Desktop after config changes
- Try absolute path to uvx in config

### Tools appear but don't work
**Solutions:**
- Check Basic Memory is installed: `basic-memory --version`
- Verify sync is running: `basic-memory status`
- Check file permissions in `~/basic-memory`
- Look for error messages in Claude Desktop

### Changes not syncing
**Solutions:**
- Confirm real-time sync is enabled (default)
- Check `basic-memory status` for sync status
- Run watcher directly: `basic-memory watch`
- Verify file is in the correct project directory
