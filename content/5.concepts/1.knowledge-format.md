title: Knowledge Format
description: Learn Basic Memory's knowledge format using standard Markdown with semantic patterns to create a knowledge graph.
---

Understanding how Basic Memory structures knowledge helps you create richer, more connected notes. Here's how the semantic patterns work.

::tip
Using Basic Memory Cloud? The knowledge format works exactly the same - create notes through AI conversations or edit directly in the [Web Editor](/cloud/cloud-guide#web-editor).
::

---

## File-First Architecture

All knowledge in Basic Memory is stored in plain text Markdown files:

::note{icon="i-lucide-info"}
- Files are the source of truth for all knowledge
- Changes to files automatically update the knowledge graph in the database
- You maintain complete ownership and control
- Files work with git and other version control systems
- Knowledge persists independently of any AI conversation
::

## Core Document Structure

Every document uses this basic structure:

```bash
---
title: Document Title
type: note
tags: [tag1, tag2]
permalink: custom-path
---

# Document Title
Regular markdown content...

## Observations
- [category] Content with #tags (optional context)

## Relations
- relation_type [[Other Document]] (optional context)
```

---

## Frontmatter

The YAML frontmatter at the top of each file defines essential metadata:

```yaml
---
title: Document Title    # Used for linking and references
type: note               # Document type
tags: [tag1, tag2]       # For organization and searching
permalink: custom-link   # Optional custom URL path
---
```

::note
The title is particularly important as it's used to create links between documents.
::

---

## Observations

Observations are facts or statements about a topic:

```bash
- [tech] Uses SQLite for storage #database
- [design] Follows plain-text architecture #architecture
- [decision] Selected bcrypt for passwords #security (Based on audit)
```

::note
Observations are markdown list items beginning with a `[category]` value. Basic Memory knows not to make Markdown checkboxes (`[ ]` or `[x]`) into observations.
::

Each observation contains:
- **Category** in [brackets] - classifies the information type
- **Content text** - the main information
- Optional **#tags** - additional categorization
- Optional **(context)** - supporting details

### Common Categories

**Primary categories:**
- `[tech]` - Technical details
- `[design]` - Architecture decisions
- `[feature]` - User capabilities
- `[decision]` - Choices that were made

**Additional categories:**
- `[principle]` - Fundamental concepts
- `[method]` - Approaches or techniques
- `[preference]` - Personal opinions
- `[fact]` - Established information
- `[question]` - Open questions or unknowns
- `[todo]` - Action items

---

## Relations

Relations connect documents to form the knowledge graph:

```bash
- implements [[Search Design]]
- depends_on [[Database Schema]]
- relates_to [[User Interface]]
```

::note
Relations are markdown list items beginning with a descriptive word, followed by a `[[wiki link]]` value. The description becomes the relationship type.
::

You can also create inline references:
```bash
This builds on [[Core Design]] and uses [[Utility Functions]].
```

### Common Relation Types

- `implements` - Implementation of a specification
- `depends_on` - Required dependency
- `relates_to` - General connection
- `inspired_by` - Source of ideas
- `extends` - Enhancement
- `part_of` - Component relationship
- `contains` - Hierarchical relationship
- `pairs_with` - Complementary relationship
- `replaces` - Supersedes another document
- `references` - Citation or mention

---

## Knowledge Graph

Basic Memory automatically builds a knowledge graph from your document connections:

- Each document becomes a node in the graph
- Relations create edges between nodes
- Relation types add semantic meaning to connections
- Forward references can link to documents that don't exist yet

      ENTITY ||--o{ OBSERVATION : has
      ENTITY ||--o{ RELATION : has
      RELATION }o--|| ENTITY : "links to"

      ENTITY {
          string title
          string permalink
          string content
          array tags
      }

      OBSERVATION {
          string category
          string content
          array tags
          string context
      }

      RELATION {
          string type
          string target
          string context
      }

This graph enables rich context building and navigation across your knowledge base.

## Permalinks

Every document has a unique **permalink** that serves as its stable identifier.

### How Permalinks Work

::note{icon="i-lucide-info"}
- **Automatically assigned**: The system generates a permalink for each document
- **Based on title**: By default, derived from the document title
- **Always unique**: If conflicts exist, the system adds a suffix
- **Stable reference**: Remains the same even if the file moves
- **Used in memory:// URLs**: Forms the basis of the addressing scheme
::

You can specify a custom permalink in the frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: Authentication Approaches
permalink: auth-approaches-2024
---
```

If not specified, one will be generated automatically from the title.

### Permalink Stability

By default, a note's permalink value will not change if the file is moved - it's a **stable** identifier. To change this behavior, edit `~/.basic-memory/config.json`:

```json
{
  "update_permalinks_on_move": true
}
```

---

## Memory URLs

The `memory://` URL scheme provides a reliable way to reference knowledge:

```
memory://auth-approaches-2024        # Direct access by permalink
memory://Authentication Approaches   # Access by title (resolves automatically)
memory://project/auth-approaches     # Access by path
```

### Pattern Matching

Memory URLs support pattern matching for powerful queries:

```
memory://auth*                      # All documents starting with "auth"
memory://*/approaches               # All documents ending with "approaches"
memory://project/*/requirements     # All requirements in project folder
memory://docs/search/implements/*   # Follow all implements relations
```

This addressing scheme ensures content remains accessible even as your knowledge base evolves and files are reorganized.

---

## File Organization

Organize files in any structure that suits your needs:

```
docs/
  architecture/
    design.md
    patterns.md
  features/
    search.md
    auth.md
```

You can:
- Group by topic in folders
- Use a flat structure with descriptive filenames
- Tag files for easier discovery
- Add custom metadata in frontmatter

::note
The system builds the semantic knowledge graph regardless of how you organize your files.
