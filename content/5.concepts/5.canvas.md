# Canvas Visualizations

Basic Memory can create visual knowledge maps using Obsidian's Canvas feature. These visualizations help you understand relationships between concepts, map out processes, and visualize your knowledge structure.

## Creating Canvas Visualizations

Ask Claude to create a visualization by describing what you want to map:

- **Example Requests** — - "Create a canvas visualization of my project components and their relationships." - "Make a concept map showing the main themes from our discussion about climate change." - "Can you make a canvas diagram of the perfect pour over method?"

## Types of Visualizations

Basic Memory can create several types of visual maps:

- **Document Maps** — Visualize connections between your notes and documents
- **Concept Maps** — Create visual representations of ideas and their relationships
- **Process Diagrams** — Map workflows, sequences, and procedures
- **Thematic Analysis** — Organize ideas around central themes

### Relationship Networks

Show how different entities relate to each other in your knowledge base.

## Visualization Sources

Claude can create visualizations based on:

### Documents in Your Knowledge Base

```example
You: "Create a canvas showing the connections between my project planning documents"
```

### Conversation Content

```example
You: "Make a canvas visualization of the main points we just discussed"
```

### Search Results

```example
You: "Find all my notes about psychology and create a visual map of the concepts"
```

### Themes and Relationships

```example
You: "Create a visual map showing how different philosophical schools relate to each other"
```

## Visualization Workflow

::steps
### Request a visualization
Describe what you want to see by asking Claude to create a canvas

### Claude creates the canvas file
The canvas file is automatically created in your Basic Memory directory

### Open the file in Obsidian
View the visualization in Obsidian's Canvas feature

### Refine the visualization
Ask Claude for adjustments:
- "Could you reorganize the canvas to group related components together?"
- "Please add more detail about the connection between these two concepts."

## Technical Details

Behind the scenes, the AI:

::note
1. Creates a `.canvas` file in JSON format
2. Adds nodes for each concept or document
3. Creates edges to represent relationships
4. Sets positions for visual clarity
5. Includes any relevant metadata
::

The resulting file is fully compatible with Obsidian's Canvas feature and can be edited directly in Obsidian.

## Tips for Effective Visualizations

- **Be Specific** — Clearly describe what you want to visualize
- **Specify Detail Level** — Mention how much detail you need
- **Mention Type** — Specify the visualization type (concept map, process flow, etc.)
- **Start Simple** — Begin with basic visualizations and ask for refinements

::note
**Provide context** about what documents or concepts to include for the best results.
