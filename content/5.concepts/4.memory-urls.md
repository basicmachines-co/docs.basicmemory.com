title: Memory URLs
description: Address notes directly with memory:// paths.
---

Memory URLs let tools reference notes directly by path or permalink. They are useful for linking and for tool calls like `build_context`.

## Reference a note by path

```
memory://project/authentication.md
```

## Reference a note by permalink

```
memory://auth-approaches-2024
```

## Use wildcards

```
memory://auth*
```
