title: Memory URLs
description: Address notes directly with memory:// paths, including project-prefixed routing.
---

Memory URLs let tools reference knowledge directly by path/permalink pattern. They are used heavily by `read_note` and `build_context`.

---

## Basic forms

### By title/permalink

```text
memory://auth-approaches-2024
```

### By path

```text
memory://docs/authentication
memory://docs/authentication.md
```

### By wildcard

```text
memory://docs/*
memory://auth*
```

---

## Project-prefixed URLs

With project-prefixed permalink behavior enabled (default), memory URLs can include project scope:

```text
memory://main/docs/authentication
memory://research/specs/search-ranking
```

This is useful when the same note title exists in multiple projects.

---

## Cross-project references in links

Within notes, project namespace syntax is normalized:

```text
project::note-path
```

is treated as:

```text
project/note-path
```

This improves cross-project resolution and keeps links explicit.

---

## Where Memory URLs are used

- `read_note(identifier="memory://...")`
- `build_context(url="memory://...")`
- assistant workflows that pass stable references between calls

---

## Resolution behavior

At runtime, Basic Memory resolves memory URLs in this order:

### 1. Project constraints

If the MCP server was started with `BASIC_MEMORY_MCP_PROJECT=research`, all URLs are resolved within the `research` project regardless of any prefix in the URL:

```text
memory://docs/auth  →  resolves in "research" project only
```

### 2. Explicit project prefix

If no constraint is set, the URL is checked for a project prefix. The first path segment is compared against known project names:

```text
memory://main/docs/auth       →  resolves in "main" project
memory://research/specs/api   →  resolves in "research" project
```

### 3. Default project fallback

If no constraint exists and no project prefix matches, the URL resolves in the default project:

```text
memory://docs/auth  →  resolves in default project (typically "main")
```

### Project-prefix extraction

When `permalinks_include_project` is enabled (the default), Basic Memory checks whether the first path segment of a URL matches a known project name. If it does, that segment is stripped and used as the project context:

```text
memory://main/specs/api-design
         ^^^^                    →  project = "main"
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   →  path = "specs/api-design"
```

If the first segment doesn't match any known project, the entire path is treated as a note path within the default project.

## Best practices

- Use project-prefixed URLs in multi-project workflows
- Prefer permalinks for stability over titles when possible
- Use wildcards for discovery, then switch to exact references
