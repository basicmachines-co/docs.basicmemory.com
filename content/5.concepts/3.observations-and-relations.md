title: Observations and relations
description: Use structured lines to make notes searchable and connected.
---

Observations and relations are light structure on top of Markdown. They help search and give your assistant more context.

## Capture observations

Use short, tagged statements:

```bash [notes/system-design.md]
- [decision] Use Postgres for primary storage #database
- [risk] Latency spikes under heavy load #performance
```

## Add relations

Use wiki‑style links to connect notes with meaning:

```bash [notes/system-design.md]
## Relations
- depends_on [[Caching Layer]]
- relates_to [[Latency Budget]]
```

## Why it matters

Observations make search precise. Relations explain how notes connect, which helps assistants build better context.
