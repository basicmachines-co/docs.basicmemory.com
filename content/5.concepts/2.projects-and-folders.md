description: How projects map to folders on disk or in the Cloud.
---

Projects are top‑level containers. Each project maps to a folder tree.

## Create a project

```bash
bm project add "work" ~/Documents/work-notes
```

## Set the default project

```bash
bm project default "work"
```

## Organize with folders

Use normal folders inside a project. The folder structure is preserved in Cloud and local modes.

## When to use multiple projects

Use separate projects when you want strict boundaries (work vs personal, client vs internal).
