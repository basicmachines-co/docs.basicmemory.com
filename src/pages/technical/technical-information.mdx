## Architecture

Basic Memory consists of:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Core Knowledge Engine">
    Parses and indexes Markdown files
  </Card>
  <Card title="SQLite Database">
    Provides fast querying and search
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP Server">
    Implements the Model Context Protocol
  </Card>
  <Card title="CLI Tools">
    Command-line utilities for management
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Card title="Sync Service">
  Monitors file changes and updates the database
</Card>

<Info>
  The system follows a **file-first architecture** where all knowledge is represented in standard Markdown files and the database serves as a secondary index.
</Info>

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Basic Memory implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/spec), an open standard for enabling AI models to access external tools:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Standardized Interface">
    Common protocol for tool integration
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tool Registration">
    Basic Memory registers as a tool provider
  </Card>
  <Card title="Asynchronous Communication">
    Enables efficient interaction with AI models
  </Card>
  <Card title="Standardized Schema">
    Structured data exchange format
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Integration with Claude Desktop uses the MCP to grant Claude access to your knowledge base through a set of specialized tools that search, read, and write knowledge.

</CardGroup>

## Data Storage and Privacy

Basic Memory is designed with privacy as a core principle:

<Info>
  **Privacy-First Design:**
  - **Local-First**: All data remains on your local machine
  - **No Cloud Dependency**: No remote servers or accounts required
  - **Telemetry**: Optional and disabled by default
  - **Standard Formats**: All data is stored in standard file formats you control
</Info>

## Implementation Details

Knowledge in Basic Memory is organized as a semantic graph:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Entities">
    Distinct concepts represented by Markdown documents
  </Step>
  <Step title="Observations">
    Categorized facts and information about entities
  </Step>
  <Step title="Relations">
    Connections between entities that form the knowledge graph
  </Step>
</Steps>

This structure emerges from simple text patterns in standard Markdown:

### Example Markdown Input

```markdown
---
title: Coffee Brewing Methods
type: note
permalink: coffee/coffee-brewing-methods
tags:
- '#coffee'
- '#brewing'
- '#methods'
- '#demo'
---

# Coffee Brewing Methods

An exploration of different coffee brewing techniques, their characteristics, and how they affect flavor extraction.

## Overview

Coffee brewing is both an art and a science. Different brewing methods extract different compounds from coffee beans,
resulting in unique flavor profiles, body, and mouthfeel. The key variables in any brewing method are:

- Grind size
- Water temperature
- Brew time
- Coffee-to-water ratio
- Agitation/turbulence

## Observations

- [principle] Coffee extraction follows a predictable pattern: acids extract first, then sugars, then bitter compounds
  #extraction
- [method] Pour over methods generally produce cleaner, brighter cups with more distinct flavor notes #clarity

## Relations

- requires [[Proper Grinding Technique]]
- affects [[Flavor Extraction]]
```

Basic Memory understands how to build context via its semantic graph.

### Entity Model

Basic Memory's core data model consists of:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Entities">
    Documents in your knowledge base
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observations">
    Facts or statements about entities
  </Card>
  <Card title="Relations">
    Connections between entities
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tags">
    Additional categorization for entities and observations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The system parses Markdown files to extract this structured information while preserving the human-readable format.

### Files as Source of Truth

Plain Markdown files store all knowledge, making it accessible with any text editor and easy to version with git.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Hybrid Search">
    Uses a combination of full-text search and semantic matching
  </Card>
  <Card title="Comprehensive Indexing">
    Indexes observations, relations, and content
