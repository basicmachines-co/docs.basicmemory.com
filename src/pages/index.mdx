Basic Memory transforms how you work with AI - instead of losing valuable insights in conversation history, you build a persistent knowledge base where both you and AI can read, write, and enhance each other's work.

![hero](/attachments/hero.png)

## True AI Collaboration

Unlike typical AI tools where you ask questions and get answers, Basic Memory creates **genuine collaboration**:

- **You capture ideas quickly** → **AI structures and enhances them**
- **AI creates comprehensive research** → **You add personal insights and connections**  
- **Both build on each other's work** → **Knowledge grows smarter over time**
- **Your notes are local** → **Edit and update notes and changes are synced**


Every note becomes part of a **semantic knowledge graph** that reveals connections you never would have seen otherwise.

## Pick up conversations exactly where you left off

No more "Can you remind me what we discussed?" or "Here's what I learned before..." - AI assistants access your **entire knowledge history** instantly.

```
You: "Continue our discussion about the database architecture"

AI: [Loads relevant context from your knowledge base]
"Based on our previous conversations and your notes about performance requirements, 
I see we were exploring PostgreSQL vs. MongoDB. Looking at your updated benchmarking 
results from last week..."
```


## Knowledge that compounds

Basic Memory doesn't just save chat snippets - AI creates **comprehensive, detailed notes** that connect to everything you've learned before:

### Beyond Chat Summaries

- **2,000+ word research documents** instead of brief summaries
- **Technical deep-dives** that build on previous architecture decisions  
- **Creative project notes** that track character development and plot evolution
- **Personal reflections** that reveal life patterns and growth over time

### Semantic Connections
Every piece of knowledge is semantically tagged and related:

```markdown
## Neural Networks Research
- [breakthrough] Transformer architecture revolutionized NLP #architecture
- [application] Enables large language models like GPT and Claude #llm
- [limitation] Computational requirements limit accessibility #resource-constraint

## Relations
- builds_on [[Artificial Intelligence History]]
- enables [[Modern AI Applications]]  
- influences [[AI Ethics Considerations]]
```

The knowledge graph **automatically suggests connections** across domains - your AI research might connect to philosophy notes, which link to creative writing projects.

## Real-Time Knowledge Flow

**Morning research session:**
```
You: "Research quantum computing applications in cryptography"
AI: [Creates detailed 3,000-word analysis with technical details, 
     current research, and connections to your existing crypto notes]
```

**Afternoon development work:**
```  
You: "Document the authentication system we just built"
AI: [Reads your code, connects to security best practices from your 
     knowledge base, creates comprehensive API documentation]
```

**Evening reflection:**
```
You: "Add today's insights to my learning journal"  
AI: [Reviews day's knowledge creation, identifies patterns,
     connects to personal growth goals and career development]
```

Each interaction **builds on everything before it** - creating knowledge that gets more valuable over time.

## Designed for Collaboration

Basic Memory implements the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, enabling direct integration with AI assistants. This isn't just file sharing - it's real-time collaborative access where both you and AI can read, write, search, and manage your knowledge base through natural conversation.

### AI Integration
- **Claude Desktop** - View, edit, and manage your notes directly through chat. Ask Claude to create notes, search your knowledge, or display notes as formatted artifacts
- **Claude Code** - Persistent context across development sessions with full MCP tool access  
- **Cursor** - AI-powered coding with project memory and native MCP support
- **VS Code** - Code editing with real-time sync to knowledge graph

### Human-Friendly
- **Plain Markdown files** you can edit in any text editor
- **Folder organization** that matches how you think
- **Git compatibility** for version control and team sharing
- **Search and discovery** across your entire knowledge base
