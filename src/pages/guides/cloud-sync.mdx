The Basic Memory Cloud CLI provides seamless integration between local and cloud knowledge bases using **project-scoped synchronization**. Each project can optionally sync with the cloud, giving you fine-grained control over what syncs and where.

## Overview

The cloud CLI enables you to:

- **Toggle cloud mode** - All regular `bm` commands work with cloud when enabled
- **Project-scoped sync** - Each project independently manages its sync configuration
- **Explicit operations** - Sync only what you want, when you want
- **Bidirectional sync** - Keep local and cloud in sync with rclone bisync
- **Offline access** - Work locally, sync when ready

## Prerequisites

Before using Basic Memory Cloud sync, you need:

- **Active Subscription**: An active Basic Memory Cloud subscription is required to access cloud features
- **Subscribe**: Visit [https://basicmemory.com/subscribe](https://basicmemory.com/subscribe) to sign up
- **Basic Memory CLI**: Cloud sync requires the CLI. See [Local Installation](/getting-started#local-installation) for installation steps.

<Warning>
If you attempt to log in without an active subscription, you'll receive a "Subscription Required" error with a link to subscribe.
</Warning>

### Why Use Sync?

<Tip>
**When to use sync:**

Sync is designed for **hybrid workflows** where you want to edit files locally (in tools like Obsidian or VS Code) while keeping cloud in sync.

**Use sync when:**
- You want to edit notes locally in your preferred editor
- You need bidirectional sync (changes flow both ways automatically)
- You're working with large knowledge bases
- You want offline access with periodic syncing

**Alternatives to sync:**

If you don't need local editing, you can work directly in the cloud:
- **Web Editor**: Upload and edit files in the [Basic Memory Cloud web interface](/guides/cloud#web-editor)
- **MCP Tools Only**: Use AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT) to manage notes entirely in cloud via MCP tools

Sync is optional - choose the workflow that fits your needs.
</Tip>

## Architecture: Project-Scoped Sync

### How It Works

Projects can exist in three states:

1. **Cloud-only** - Project exists on cloud, no local copy
2. **Cloud + Local (synced)** - Project has a local working directory that syncs
3. **Local-only** - Project exists locally (when cloud mode is disabled)

**Example:**

```bash
# You have 3 projects on cloud:
# - research: wants local sync at ~/Documents/research
# - work: wants local sync at ~/work-notes
# - temp: cloud-only, no local sync needed

bm project add research --local-path ~/Documents/research
bm project add work --local-path ~/work-notes
bm project add temp  # No local sync

# Now you can sync individually (after initial --resync):
bm project bisync --name research
bm project bisync --name work
# temp stays cloud-only
```

**What happens under the covers:**
- Config stores `cloud_projects` dict mapping project names to local paths
- Each project gets its own bisync state in `~/.basic-memory/bisync-state/{project}/`
- Rclone syncs using single remote: `basic-memory-cloud`
- Projects can live anywhere on your filesystem, not forced into sync directory

## Quick Start

### 1. Enable Cloud Mode

Authenticate and enable cloud mode:

```bash
bm cloud login
```

**What this does:**
1. Opens browser to Basic Memory Cloud authentication page
2. Stores authentication token in `~/.basic-memory/auth/token`
3. **Enables cloud mode** - all CLI commands now work against cloud
4. Validates your subscription status

**Result:** All `bm project`, `bm tools` commands now work with cloud.

### 2. Set Up Sync

Install rclone and configure credentials:

```bash
bm cloud setup
```

**What this does:**
1. Installs rclone automatically (if needed)
2. Fetches your tenant information from cloud
3. Generates scoped S3 credentials for sync
4. Configures single rclone remote: `basic-memory-cloud`

**Result:** You're ready to sync projects. No sync directories created yet - those come with project setup.

### 3. Add Projects with Sync

Create projects with optional local sync paths:

```bash
# Create cloud project without local sync
bm project add research

# Create cloud project WITH local sync
bm project add research --local-path ~/Documents/research

# Or configure sync for existing project
bm project sync-setup research ~/Documents/research
```

**What happens under the covers:**

When you add a project with `--local-path`:
1. Project created on cloud at `/app/data/research`
2. Local path stored in config: `cloud_projects.research.local_path = "~/Documents/research"`
3. Local directory created if it doesn't exist
4. Bisync state directory created at `~/.basic-memory/bisync-state/research/`

**Result:** Project is ready to sync, but no files synced yet.

### 4. Sync Your Project

Establish the initial sync baseline. **Best practice:** Always preview with `--dry-run` first:

```bash
# Step 1: Preview the initial sync (recommended)
bm project bisync --name research --resync --dry-run

# Step 2: If all looks good, run the actual sync
bm project bisync --name research --resync
```

**What happens under the covers:**
1. Rclone reads from `~/Documents/research` (local)
2. Connects to `basic-memory-cloud:bucket-name/app/data/research` (remote)
3. Creates bisync state files in `~/.basic-memory/bisync-state/research/`
4. Syncs files bidirectionally with settings:
   - `conflict_resolve=newer` (most recent wins)
   - `max_delete=25` (safety limit)
   - Respects `.bmignore` patterns

**Result:** Local and cloud are in sync. Baseline established.

<Info>
**Why `--resync`?** This is an rclone requirement for the first bisync run. It establishes the initial state that future syncs will compare against. After the first sync, never use `--resync` unless you need to force a new baseline.

See: [rclone bisync documentation](https://rclone.org/bisync/#resync)
</Info>

### 5. Subsequent Syncs

After the first sync, just run bisync without `--resync`:

```bash
bm project bisync --name research
```

**What happens:**
1. Rclone compares local and cloud states
2. Syncs changes in both directions
3. Auto-resolves conflicts (newer file wins)
4. Basic Memory reindexes all changed files
5. Updates `last_sync` timestamp in config

**Result:** Changes flow both ways - edit locally or in cloud, both stay in sync.

<Note>
**Reindexing after sync**: Basic Memory automatically reindexes all synced changes to update the knowledge graph. For large changes (many files), this may take a few moments to complete.
</Note>

### 6. Verify Setup

Check status:

```bash
bm cloud status
```

You should see:
- `Mode: Cloud (enabled)`
- `Cloud instance is healthy`
- Instructions for project sync commands

## Working with Projects

### Understanding Project Commands

<Note>
**Key concept:** When cloud mode is enabled, use regular `bm project` commands (not `bm cloud project`).

```bash
# In cloud mode:
bm project list              # Lists cloud projects
bm project add research      # Creates cloud project

# In local mode:
bm project list              # Lists local projects
bm project add research ~/Documents/research  # Creates local project
```
</Note>

### Creating Projects

**Use case 1: Cloud-only project (no local sync)**

```bash
bm project add temp-notes
```

**What this does:**
- Creates project on cloud at `/app/data/temp-notes`
- No local directory created
- No sync configuration

**Result:** Project exists on cloud, accessible via MCP tools, but no local copy.

**Use case 2: Cloud project with local sync**

```bash
bm project add research --local-path ~/Documents/research
```

**What this does:**
- Creates project on cloud at `/app/data/research`
- Creates local directory `~/Documents/research`
- Stores sync config in `~/.basic-memory/config.json`
- Prepares for bisync (but doesn't sync yet)

**Result:** Project ready to sync. Run `bm project bisync --name research --resync` to establish baseline.

**Use case 3: Add sync to existing cloud project**

```bash
# Project already exists on cloud
bm project sync-setup research ~/Documents/research
```

**What this does:**
- Updates existing project's sync configuration
- Creates local directory
- Prepares for bisync

**Result:** Existing cloud project now has local sync path. Run bisync to pull files down.

### Listing Projects

View all projects:

```bash
bm project list
```

**What you see:**
- All projects in cloud (when cloud mode enabled)
- Default project marked
- Project paths shown

## File Synchronization

### Understanding the Sync Commands

There are three sync-related commands:

1. **`bm project sync`** - One-way: local → cloud (make cloud match local)
2. **`bm project bisync`** - Two-way: local ↔ cloud (recommended)
3. **`bm project check`** - Verify files match (no changes)

### One-Way Sync: Local → Cloud

**Use case:** You made changes locally and want to push to cloud (overwrite cloud).

```bash
bm project sync --name research
```

**What happens:**
1. Reads files from `~/Documents/research` (local)
2. Uses rclone sync to make cloud identical to local
3. Respects `.bmignore` patterns
4. Shows progress bar

**Result:** Cloud now matches local exactly. Any cloud-only changes are overwritten.

**When to use:**
- You know local is the source of truth
- You want to force cloud to match local
- You don't care about cloud changes

### Two-Way Sync: Local ↔ Cloud (Recommended)

**Use case:** You edit files both locally and in cloud UI, want both to stay in sync.

```bash
# First time - establish baseline
bm project bisync --name research --resync

# Subsequent syncs
bm project bisync --name research
```

**What happens:**
1. Compares local and cloud states using bisync metadata
2. Syncs changes in both directions
3. Auto-resolves conflicts (newer file wins)
4. Detects excessive deletes and fails safely (max 25 files)

**Conflict resolution example:**

```bash
# Edit locally
echo "Local change" > ~/Documents/research/notes.md

# Edit same file in cloud UI
# Cloud now has: "Cloud change"

# Run bisync
bm project bisync --name research

# Result: Newer file wins (based on modification time)
# If cloud was more recent, cloud version kept
# If local was more recent, local version kept
```

**When to use:**
- Default workflow for most users
- You edit in multiple places
- You want automatic conflict resolution

### Verify Sync Integrity

**Use case:** Check if local and cloud match without making changes.

```bash
bm project check --name research
```

**What happens:**
1. Compares file checksums between local and cloud
2. Reports differences
3. No files transferred

**Result:** Shows which files differ. Run bisync to sync them.

```bash
# One-way check (faster)
bm project check --name research --one-way
```

### Preview Changes (Dry Run)

**Use case:** See what would change without actually syncing.

```bash
bm project bisync --name research --dry-run
```

**What happens:**
1. Runs bisync logic
2. Shows what would be transferred/deleted
3. No actual changes made

**Result:** Safe preview of sync operations.

### Advanced: List Remote Files

**Use case:** See what files exist on cloud without syncing.

```bash
# List all files in project
bm project ls --name research

# List files in subdirectory
bm project ls --name research --path subfolder
```

**What happens:**
1. Connects to cloud via rclone
2. Lists files in remote project path
3. No files transferred

**Result:** See cloud file listing.

## Multiple Projects

### Syncing Multiple Projects

**Use case:** You have several projects with local sync, want to sync all at once.

```bash
# Setup multiple projects
bm project add research --local-path ~/Documents/research
bm project add work --local-path ~/work-notes
bm project add personal --local-path ~/personal

# Establish baselines
bm project bisync --name research --resync
bm project bisync --name work --resync
bm project bisync --name personal --resync

# Daily workflow: sync everything
bm project bisync --name research
bm project bisync --name work
bm project bisync --name personal
```

### Mixed Usage

**Use case:** Some projects sync, some stay cloud-only.

```bash
# Projects with sync
bm project add research --local-path ~/Documents/research
bm project add work --local-path ~/work

# Cloud-only projects
bm project add archive
bm project add temp-notes

# Sync only the configured ones
bm project bisync --name research
bm project bisync --name work

# Archive and temp-notes stay cloud-only
```

**Result:** Fine-grained control over what syncs.

## Disable Cloud Mode

Return to local mode:

```bash
bm cloud logout
```

**What this does:**
1. Disables cloud mode in config
2. All commands now work locally
3. Auth token remains (can re-enable with login)

**Result:** All `bm` commands work with local projects again.

## Filter Configuration

### Understanding .bmignore

**The problem:** You don't want to sync everything (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`, database files).

**The solution:** `.bmignore` file with gitignore-style patterns.

<Note>
Basic Memory already respects `.gitignore` files in your projects. See [Controlling What Gets Indexed](/user-guide#controlling-what-gets-indexed) for details. Use `.bmignore` when you need a **global ignore list** that applies across all your projects.
</Note>

**Location:** `~/.basic-memory/.bmignore`

**Default patterns:**

```gitignore
# Version control
.git/**

# Python
__pycache__/**
*.pyc
.venv/**
venv/**

# Node.js
node_modules/**

# Basic Memory internals
memory.db/**
memory.db-shm/**
memory.db-wal/**
config.json/**
watch-status.json/**
.bmignore.rclone/**

# OS files
.DS_Store/**
Thumbs.db/**

# Environment files
.env/**
.env.local/**
```

**How it works:**
1. On first sync, `.bmignore` created with defaults
2. Patterns converted to rclone filter format (`.bmignore.rclone`)
3. Rclone uses filters during sync
4. Same patterns used by all projects

**Customizing:**

```bash
# Edit patterns
code ~/.basic-memory/.bmignore

# Add custom patterns
echo "*.tmp/**" >> ~/.basic-memory/.bmignore

# Next sync uses updated patterns
bm project bisync --name research
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Authentication failed or Invalid token">
    **Solution:** Re-authenticate:

    ```bash
    bm cloud logout
    bm cloud login
    ```
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Subscription Issues

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Subscription Required error">
    **Solution:**
    1. Visit subscribe URL shown in error
    2. Sign up for subscription
    3. Run `bm cloud login` again

    **Note:** Access is immediate when subscription becomes active.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Bisync Initialization

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="First bisync requires --resync">
    **Explanation:** Bisync needs a baseline state before it can sync changes.

    **Solution:**

    ```bash
    bm project bisync --name research --resync
    ```

    **What this does:**
    - Establishes initial sync state
    - Creates baseline in `~/.basic-memory/bisync-state/research/`
    - Syncs all files bidirectionally

    **Result:** Future syncs work without `--resync`.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Empty Directory Issues

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Empty prior Path1 listing. Cannot sync to an empty directory">
    **Explanation:** Rclone bisync doesn't work well with completely empty directories. It needs at least one file to establish a baseline.

    **Solution:** Add at least one file before running `--resync`:

    ```bash
    # Create a placeholder file
    echo "# Research Notes" > ~/Documents/research/README.md

    # Now run bisync
    bm project bisync --name research --resync
    ```

    **Why this happens:** Bisync creates listing files that track the state of each side. When both directories are completely empty, these listing files are considered invalid by rclone.

    **Best practice:** Always have at least one file (like a README.md) in your project directory before setting up sync.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Bisync State Corruption

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Bisync fails with errors about corrupted state or listing files">
    **Explanation:** Sometimes bisync state can become inconsistent (e.g., after mixing dry-run and actual runs, or after manual file operations).

    **Solution:** Clear bisync state and re-establish baseline:

    ```bash
    # Clear bisync state
    bm project bisync-reset research

    # Re-establish baseline
    bm project bisync --name research --resync
    ```

    **What this does:**
    - Removes all bisync metadata from `~/.basic-memory/bisync-state/research/`
    - Forces fresh baseline on next `--resync`
    - Safe operation (doesn't touch your files)

    **Note:** This command also runs automatically when you remove a project to clean up state directories.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Too Many Deletes

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Error: max delete limit (25) exceeded">
    **Explanation:** Bisync detected you're about to delete more than 25 files. This is a safety check to prevent accidents.

    **Solution 1:** Review what you're deleting, then force resync:

    ```bash
    # Check what would be deleted
    bm project bisync --name research --dry-run

    # If correct, establish new baseline
    bm project bisync --name research --resync
    ```

    **Solution 2:** Use one-way sync if you know local is correct:

    ```bash
    bm project sync --name research
    ```
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Project Not Configured for Sync

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Project research has no local_sync_path configured">
    **Explanation:** Project exists on cloud but has no local sync path.

    **Solution:**

    ```bash
    bm project sync-setup research ~/Documents/research
    bm project bisync --name research --resync
    ```
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Connection Issues

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Cannot connect to cloud instance">
    **Solution:** Check status:

    ```bash
    bm cloud status
    ```

    If instance is down, wait a few minutes and retry.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Security

- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.1 with PKCE flow
- **Tokens**: Stored securely in `~/.basic-memory/basic-memory-cloud.json`
- **Transport**: All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- **Credentials**: Scoped S3 credentials (read-write to your tenant only)
- **Isolation**: Your data isolated from other tenants
- **Ignore patterns**: Sensitive files automatically excluded via `.bmignore`

## Command Reference

### Cloud Mode Management

```bash
bm cloud login              # Authenticate and enable cloud mode
bm cloud logout             # Disable cloud mode
bm cloud status             # Check cloud mode and instance health
```

### Setup

```bash
bm cloud setup              # Install rclone and configure credentials
```

### Project Management

When cloud mode is enabled:

```bash
bm project list                           # List cloud projects
bm project add <name>                     # Create cloud project (no sync)
bm project add <name> --local-path <path> # Create with local sync
bm project sync-setup <name> <path>       # Add sync to existing project
bm project rm <name>                      # Delete project
```

### File Synchronization

```bash
# One-way sync (local → cloud)
bm project sync --name <project>
bm project sync --name <project> --dry-run
bm project sync --name <project> --verbose

# Two-way sync (local ↔ cloud) - Recommended
bm project bisync --name <project>          # After first --resync
bm project bisync --name <project> --resync # First time / force baseline
bm project bisync --name <project> --dry-run
bm project bisync --name <project> --verbose

# Integrity check
bm project check --name <project>
bm project check --name <project> --one-way

# List remote files
bm project ls --name <project>
bm project ls --name <project> --path <subpath>
```

## Summary

**Basic Memory Cloud uses project-scoped sync:**

1. **Enable cloud mode** - `bm cloud login`
2. **Install rclone** - `bm cloud setup`
3. **Add projects with sync** - `bm project add research --local-path ~/Documents/research`
4. **Preview first sync** - `bm project bisync --name research --resync --dry-run`
5. **Establish baseline** - `bm project bisync --name research --resync`
6. **Daily workflow** - `bm project bisync --name research`

**Key benefits:**
- ✅ Each project independently syncs (or doesn't)
- ✅ Projects can live anywhere on disk
- ✅ Explicit sync operations (no magic)
- ✅ Safe by design (max delete limits, conflict resolution)
- ✅ Full offline access (work locally, sync when ready)
