## Command line Quick Start

Basic Memory Cloud requires version v0.15.2 or later of the Basic Memory CLI tools. See the install and upgrade
instructions on the <a href="/getting-started">Getting Started</a> page.

<Info>
    You can use the shorter command alias `bm` instead of `basic-memory` for all CLI commands (e.g., `bm cloud login` instead of `basic-memory cloud login`).
</Info>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Authenticate">
        ```bash
        bm cloud login
        ```
        Opens browser for OAuth 2.1 authentication, then displays an authorization code.

    </Step>


    <Step title="Check Status">
        ```bash
        bm cloud status
        ```
        View your authentication status, subscription, and cloud project information.
    </Step>

    <Step title="List Projects">
        ```bash
        bm project list
        ```
        Shows all your cloud projects with their paths and default status.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication

Basic Memory uses JWT-based cloud authentication with OAuth 2.1 and automatic subscription validation.

### Login to Cloud

Authenticate with Basic Memory Cloud:

```bash
bm cloud login
```

**What happens:**
1. Opens browser to OAuth authorization page
2. Handles PKCE challenge/response automatically
3. Validates active subscription status
4. Stores JWT token in `~/.basic-memory/basic-memory-cloud.json`
5. Token automatically refreshed when needed

**Browser Confirmation Code**

    <img src="/device-activation.png" alt="Device Activation" height="200"/>
</Card>

**Terminal**

In the terminal, the same code will be displayed. Confirm the codes match and press the **Confirm** button
on the web page.

```
 bm cloud login
Initiating authentication...

🔐 Authentication Required

To authenticate, please visit:
https://eloquent-lotus-05.authkit.app/device

And enter this code: XXX-XXX

Or for one-click access, visit:
https://eloquent-lotus-05.authkit.app/device?user_code=XXX-XXX

Opening browser automatically...

Waiting for you to complete authentication in your browser...
```

After you login and confirm via the web browser, your auth token will be saved locally.
```
✅ Successfully authenticated with Basic Memory Cloud!
Verifying subscription access...
✓ Cloud mode enabled
All CLI commands now work against https://cloud.basicmemory.com
✓ Tokens saved to ~/.basic-memory/basic-memory-cloud.json
```

<Info>
    **Important:** After `bm cloud login`, CLI tools access cloud endpoints instead of local MCP. Commands like `bm
    project list` show cloud projects, and `bm tool [name]` invokes tools in the cloud. Use the same CLI commands for
    both local and cloud projects.
</Info>

**If no subscription:**
```
Active subscription required
Subscribe at: https://basicmemory.com/subscribe
```

### Check Authentication Status

View current authentication and cloud status:

```bash
bm cloud status
```

**Output shows:**
- Authentication status (logged in/out)
- Subscription status (active/expired)
- Last sync time
- Cloud project count
- Tenant information
- Sync directory configuration

### Logout

Clear authentication session:

```bash
bm cloud logout
```

Removes `~/.basic-memory/basic-memory-cloud.json` and clears cached credentials. All cloud commands will require re-authentication.

## Manage Cloud Projects from the command line

### Creating Projects

Create a new project

```bash
# In cloud mode - creates cloud project
bm project add my-new-project

# Create and set as default
bm project add my-new-project --default
```

### List Projects

List Projects

```bash
bm project list
           Basic Memory Projects
┏━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Name ┃ Path                   ┃ Default ┃
┡━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━┩
│ main │ /app/data/basic-memory │ ✓       │
└──────┴────────────────────────┴─────────┘
```

Other project management commands are available. See `bm project --help`.

## Upload files to Cloud Projects

You can directly upload local files or directories to cloud projects using `bm cloud upload`. This is useful for:
- Migrating existing local projects to the cloud
- Quickly uploading specific files or directories
- One-time bulk uploads without setting up sync

**Basic Usage:**

```bash
# Upload a directory to existing project
bm cloud upload ~/my-notes --project research

# Upload a single file
bm cloud upload important-doc.md --project research
```

**Create Project On-the-Fly:**

If the target project doesn't exist yet, use `--create-project`:

```bash
# Upload and create project in one step
bm cloud upload ~/local-project --project new-research --create-project
```

**Skip Automatic Sync:**

By default, the command syncs the project after upload to index the files. To skip this:

```bash
# Upload without triggering sync
bm cloud upload ~/bulk-data --project archives --no-sync
```

**File Filtering:**

The upload command respects `.bmignore` and `.gitignore` patterns, automatically excluding:
- Hidden files (`.git`, `.DS_Store`)
- Build artifacts (`node_modules`, `__pycache__`)
- Database files (`*.db`, `*.db-wal`)
- Environment files (`.env`)

To customize what gets uploaded, edit `~/.basic-memory/.bmignore`.

**Complete Example:**

```bash
# 1. Login to cloud
bm cloud login

# 2. Upload local project (creates project if needed)
bm cloud upload ~/specs --project specs --create-project

# 3. Verify upload
bm project list
```

**Example Output:**

```
bm cloud upload --project specs --create-project specs
