</Note>

---

## Command Line Tools

The CLI tools are **optional** but enable advanced features like project management, file upload, and bidirectional sync.

**Requirements**: Basic Memory CLI v0.16.0 or later. See install and upgrade instructions on the [Getting Started](/getting-started) page.

<Info>
**Why use the CLI?**
- Manage multiple projects from terminal
- Upload entire folders to cloud
- Set up bidirectional sync with local files
- Automate workflows with scripts
</Info>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Authenticate">
        ```bash
        bm cloud login
        ```
        Opens browser for OAuth 2.1 authentication, then displays an authorization code.

    </Step>


    <Step title="Check Status">
        ```bash
        bm cloud status
        ```
        View your authentication status, subscription, and cloud project information.
    </Step>

    <Step title="List Projects">
        ```bash
        bm project list
        ```
        Shows all your cloud projects with their paths and default status.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Authentication

Basic Memory uses JWT-based cloud authentication with OAuth 2.1 and automatic subscription validation.

### Login to Cloud

Authenticate with Basic Memory Cloud:

```bash
bm cloud login
```

**What happens:**
1. Opens browser to OAuth authorization page
2. Handles PKCE challenge/response automatically
3. Validates active subscription status
4. Stores JWT token in `~/.basic-memory/basic-memory-cloud.json`
5. Token automatically refreshed when needed

**Browser Confirmation Code**
![Device Activation](/device-activation.png)

**Terminal**

In the terminal, the same code will be displayed. Confirm the codes match and press the **Confirm** button
on the web page.

```
 bm cloud login
Initiating authentication...

🔐 Authentication Required

To authenticate, please visit:
https://eloquent-lotus-05.authkit.app/device

And enter this code: XXX-XXX

Or for one-click access, visit:
https://eloquent-lotus-05.authkit.app/device?user_code=XXX-XXX

Opening browser automatically...

Waiting for you to complete authentication in your browser...
```

After you login and confirm via the web browser, your auth token will be saved locally.
```
✅ Successfully authenticated with Basic Memory Cloud!
Verifying subscription access...
✓ Cloud mode enabled
All CLI commands now work against https://cloud.basicmemory.com
✓ Tokens saved to ~/.basic-memory/basic-memory-cloud.json
```

<Info>
    **Important:** After `bm cloud login`, CLI tools access cloud endpoints instead of local MCP. Commands like `bm
    project list` show cloud projects, and `bm tool [name]` invokes tools in the cloud. Use the same CLI commands for
    both local and cloud projects.
</Info>

**If no subscription:**
```
Active subscription required
Subscribe at: https://basicmemory.com/subscribe
```

### Check Authentication Status

View current authentication and cloud status:

```bash
bm cloud status
```

**Output shows:**
- Authentication status (logged in/out)
- Subscription status (active/expired)
- Last sync time
- Cloud project count
- Tenant information
- Sync directory configuration

### Logout

Clear authentication session:

```bash
bm cloud logout
```

Removes `~/.basic-memory/basic-memory-cloud.json` and clears cached credentials. All cloud commands will require re-authentication.

### Project Management

Create and manage projects from the command line:

```bash
# Create a new cloud project
bm project add my-new-project

# Create and set as default
bm project add my-new-project --default

# List all cloud projects
bm project list
```

Example output:

```
           Basic Memory Projects
┏━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Name ┃ Path                   ┃ Default ┃
┡━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━┩
│ main │ /app/data/basic-memory │ ✓       │
└──────┴────────────────────────┴─────────┘
```

<Tip>
For more project management commands, see `bm project --help` or the [CLI Reference](/guides/cli-reference).
</Tip>

## Upload files to Cloud Projects

You can directly upload local files or directories to cloud projects using `bm cloud upload`. This is useful for:
- Migrating existing local projects to the cloud
- Quickly uploading specific files or directories
- One-time bulk uploads without setting up sync

**Basic Usage:**

```bash
# Upload a directory to existing project
bm cloud upload ~/my-notes --project research

# Upload a single file
bm cloud upload important-doc.md --project research
```

**Create Project On-the-Fly:**

If the target project doesn't exist yet, use `--create-project`:

```bash
# Upload and create project in one step
bm cloud upload ~/local-project --project new-research --create-project
```

**Skip Automatic Sync:**

By default, the command syncs the project after upload to index the files. To skip this:

```bash
# Upload without triggering sync
bm cloud upload ~/bulk-data --project archives --no-sync
```

**File Filtering:**

The upload command respects `.bmignore` and `.gitignore` patterns, automatically excluding:
- Hidden files (`.git`, `.DS_Store`)
- Build artifacts (`node_modules`, `__pycache__`)
- Database files (`*.db`, `*.db-wal`)
- Environment files (`.env`)

To customize what gets uploaded, edit `~/.basic-memory/.bmignore`.

**Complete Example:**

```bash
# 1. Login to cloud
bm cloud login

# 2. Upload local project (creates project if needed)
bm cloud upload ~/specs --project specs --create-project

# 3. Verify upload
bm project list
```

**Example Output:**

```
bm cloud upload --project specs --create-project specs

## Cloud Snapshots

Basic Memory Cloud includes point-in-time snapshots for backup and recovery. Snapshots let you:

- **Rollback** to a previous state after accidental changes
- **Browse** historical versions of your notes
- **Restore** individual files or entire folders
- **Protect** against accidental deletion

<Info>
Create as many snapshots as you need—there's no limit. Basic Memory Cloud also creates daily automatic snapshots, so you're always protected even if you forget to create one manually.
</Info>

### Creating Snapshots

Create a snapshot before making major changes:

```bash
# Create a named snapshot
bm cloud snapshot create "Before reorganization"

# Output:
# Created snapshot: snap_abc123 (2026-01-27T10:30:00)
```

<Tip>
Create a manual snapshot before reorganizing folders, bulk imports, or other major changes—this gives you a clear restore point if needed.
</Tip>

### Managing Snapshots

```bash
# List all snapshots
bm cloud snapshot list

# Show snapshot details
bm cloud snapshot show <snapshot-id>

# Browse files in a snapshot
bm cloud snapshot browse <snapshot-id>

# Delete a snapshot
bm cloud snapshot delete <snapshot-id>
```

Example output from `bm cloud snapshot list`:

```
snap_abc123  "Before reorganization"  Jan 27, 2026  42 MB
snap_xyz789  "daily-auto"             Jan 26, 2026  41 MB
snap_def456  "daily-auto"             Jan 25, 2026  40 MB
```

### Restoring from Snapshots

To restore files, browse the snapshot contents and download what you need:

```bash
# Browse snapshot contents
bm cloud snapshot browse snap_abc123

# Shows files available in the snapshot
# notes/project.md
# notes/ideas.md
# research/analysis.md
```

<Note>
File-level restore is available via the snapshot browse command. Select and download individual files to restore them to your current project.
</Note>

## Migrating to Cloud

Already using Basic Memory locally? You have two options to move your notes to the cloud:

### Option 1: One-Time Upload (Fastest)

Upload your existing local project to cloud:

```bash
# Login first
bm cloud login

# Upload entire project
bm cloud upload ~/basic-memory --project main --create-project
```

**Use when:**
- You want to move to cloud-only
- One-time migration is sufficient
- Don't need ongoing local-cloud sync

### Option 2: Bidirectional Sync (Hybrid Workflow)

Set up sync to work both locally and in cloud:

```bash
# Login and setup sync
bm cloud login
bm cloud setup

# Add existing project with sync enabled
bm project add main --local-path ~/basic-memory

# Initial sync (resync creates baseline)
bm project bisync --name main --resync --dry-run  # preview first
bm project bisync --name main --resync             # establish baseline

# Ongoing sync (run after local or cloud changes)
bm project bisync --name main
```

**Use when:**
- You want to edit both locally (Obsidian, VS Code) and in cloud
- Need offline access
- Want automatic bidirectional sync

<Info>
Both methods preserve all your notes, relations, and tags. Choose based on whether you want cloud-only or hybrid local+cloud workflow. See the [Cloud Sync Guide](/guides/cloud-sync) for detailed sync configuration.
