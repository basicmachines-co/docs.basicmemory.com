### Project Management Tools

## Project Modes

Basic Memory supports three different project modes to accommodate different workflows:

### Multi-Project Mode (Default)

The standard mode for users with multiple knowledge bases:

- **How it works**: AI assistants discover projects using `list_memory_projects()` and `recent_activity()`
- **Project selection**: Users specify which project to work with during conversations
- **Benefits**: Full flexibility to work across multiple projects in one session
- **Best for**: Users managing separate work, personal, and research knowledge bases

**Example workflow:**
```
Assistant: I'll check what projects you have available.
[Calls list_memory_projects()]

Assistant: I see you have 'work', 'personal', and 'research' projects. Which would you like to use?

User: Let's work with the research project

Assistant: Perfect! I'll use the 'research' project for our work.
[Uses project="research" in all subsequent tool calls]
```

### Default Project Mode

Simplified mode for single-project users:

- **How it works**: Set `default_project_mode=true` in configuration
- **Automatic selection**: Tools automatically use the default project when no project is specified
- **Benefits**: Seamless experience without repetitive project specification
- **Best for**: Users with primarily one knowledge base

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "default_project": "main",
  "default_project_mode": true
}
```

**Example workflow:**
```
User: Create a note about today's meeting

Assistant: I'll create a meeting note for you.
[Automatically uses default project 'main' - no project parameter needed]

User: Search for notes about project planning

Assistant: I'll search your knowledge base for project planning content.
[Automatically searches in default project 'main']
```

### Constrained Project Mode

Locked mode for specific workflows:

- **How it works**: Start MCP server with `--project project-name` parameter
- **Locked operation**: All tools operate within the specified project only
- **Benefits**: Prevents accidental cross-project operations
- **Best for**: Automation, and focused work sessions

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start MCP server constrained to specific project
basic-memory mcp --project work-project
```

**Example workflow:**
```
User: Create documentation for the new API

Assistant: I'll create API documentation in the work-project.
[All operations automatically constrained to 'work-project']

User: Search for existing architecture notes

Assistant: I'll search for architecture notes in the work-project.
[Search automatically limited to constrained project]
```

### Project Resolution Hierarchy

When multiple project specifications exist, Basic Memory uses this priority order:

1. **CLI Constraint** (highest priority) - `--project` parameter
2. **Explicit Parameter** (medium priority) - `project` parameter in tool call
3. **Default Project Mode** (lowest priority) - Automatic default when enabled

This ensures predictable behavior and allows explicit override when needed.

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Common Workflows

**Knowledge Creation Flow:**
```
write_note → edit_note (append/prepend) → move_note → view_note
```
*Start with basic note, enhance incrementally, organize, then review*

<details>
<summary>Example conversation</summary>

```
You: "I want to document my thoughts on the new API design"
Claude: I'll create a note for your API design thoughts.
[Uses write_note to create initial note]

You: "Add a section about authentication concerns"
Claude: I'll append an authentication section to your API design note.
[Uses edit_note with append operation]

You: "This should go in my architecture folder"
Claude: I'll move the API design note to your architecture folder.
[Uses move_note to relocate the file]

You: "Show me the final note"
Claude: Here's your complete API design note formatted for easy reading.
[Uses view_note to display formatted artifact]
```
</details>

**Research and Discovery Flow:**
```
search_notes → read_note → build_context → write_note
```
*Find existing knowledge, explore context, create new insights*

<details>
<summary>Example conversation</summary>

```
You: "I'm working on database optimization, what have I learned before?"
Claude: Let me search your knowledge base for database optimization content.
[Uses search_notes to find relevant notes]

You: "Tell me more about that PostgreSQL indexing note"
Claude: I'll read the full PostgreSQL indexing note for you.
[Uses read_note to load complete content and context]

You: "Load the context from my database performance work"
Claude: I'll gather related notes about database performance to build context.
[Uses build_context with memory:// URLs to load related content]

You: "Create a new note combining these insights for my current project"
Claude: I'll create a comprehensive note that synthesizes your database optimization knowledge.
[Uses write_note to capture new insights with full context]
```
</details>

**Project Discovery Flow:**
```
list_memory_projects → recent_activity (discovery mode) → project selection
```
*Discover projects, view cross-project activity, choose working project*

<details>
<summary>Example conversation</summary>

```
You: "What projects do I have available?"
Claude: Here are all your Basic Memory projects with their current status.
[Uses list_memory_projects to show available projects]

You: "Show me recent activity across all projects"
Claude: Here's recent activity across all your projects to help you choose which to work with.
[Uses recent_activity without project parameter for discovery mode]

You: "I want to work with my research project"
Claude: I'll use the 'research' project for our work. All subsequent operations will specify this project.
[Remembers project choice for conversation context]

You: "What have I been working on recently in this project?"
Claude: Here's your recent activity in the research project.
[Uses recent_activity with project="research" parameter]
```
</details>

**Content Organization Flow:**
```
list_directory → search_notes → move_note → list_directory
```
*Explore structure, find content, reorganize, verify changes*

<details>
<summary>Example conversation</summary>

```
You: "Show me what's in my projects folder"
Claude: Here's the structure of your projects folder.
[Uses list_directory to explore folder contents]

You: "Find all notes about the mobile app project"
Claude: I found several notes related to your mobile app project.
[Uses search_notes to locate relevant content]

You: "Move the mobile app notes to a dedicated folder"
Claude: I'll move all mobile app notes to a new 'mobile-app' folder.
[Uses move_note to reorganize content]

You: "Show me the updated folder structure"
Claude: Here's your reorganized projects folder with the new mobile-app directory.
[Uses list_directory to verify the changes]
```
</details>

### Integration Examples

**In Claude Desktop:**
```
You: "What have I been working on lately?"
Claude: [Uses recent_activity prompt for formatted response]

You: "Create a note about today's meeting"
Claude: [Uses write_note tool with semantic structure]

You: "Show me my project documentation as a formatted view"
Claude: [Uses view_note tool to display artifact]
```

**In Development Workflows:**
```
You: "Document today's architecture decisions in my work project"
Claude: [Uses write_note with project="work" parameter and technical context]

You: "Find all my API documentation in the work project and update the authentication section"
Claude: [Uses search_notes with project="work", then edit_note with section replacement]
```

## Error Handling and Best Practices

### Common Tool Parameters

**Identifiers**: Most tools accept flexible identifiers:
- Note titles: `"My Important Note"`
- Permalinks: `"my-important-note"`
- Memory URLs: `"memory://folder/note"`
- File paths: `"folder/note.md"`

**Timeframes**: Natural language supported:
- `"2 days ago"`, `"last week"`, `"today"`
- `"3 months ago"`, `"yesterday"`
- Standard formats: `"7d"`, `"24h"`

**Project Parameters**: All content tools require explicit project specification:
- Each tool call includes a `project` parameter
- Operations stay within specified project boundaries
- Session guidance helps you choose the right project

## Advanced Features

### Memory URLs

Use `memory://` URLs with `build_context` for intelligent navigation:

```
memory://project-planning          # Load specific note
memory://architecture/*           # Load all architecture notes  
memory://decisions/database-choice # Load specific decision document
```

### Project Management vs Content Tools

Basic Memory tools fall into two categories:

**Project Management Tools** (work globally):
- `list_memory_projects()` - Shows all projects
- `create_memory_project()` - Creates new project
- `delete_project()` - Removes project configuration
- `sync_status()` - Shows status across all projects

**Content Tools** (require project parameter):
- `write_note(project="...")` - Creates note in specified project
- `search_notes(project="...")` - Searches specified project only
- `edit_note(project="...")` - Edits note in specified project
- `recent_activity()` - Discovery mode (no project) or project-specific

**Example:**
```python
# Global operations
list_memory_projects()                    # Shows all projects
create_memory_project("new-project", ...) # Creates new project

# Project-specific operations
write_note("My Note", "Content", "folder", project="work")
search_notes("api documentation", project="work")
edit_note("My Note", "append", "More content", project="work")
```
