Basic Memory provides a comprehensive suite of MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools and prompts that enable AI assistants to work directly with your knowledge base. This reference catalogs all available tools and where to find detailed examples.

<Tip>
Using Basic Memory Cloud? All MCP tools work the same whether you're using cloud or local. Cloud users authenticate via OAuth and tools automatically work with your cloud projects. See the [Cloud Guide](/guides/cloud) for setup.
</Tip>

<Note>
**v0.15.0 Change**: Most MCP tools now require an explicit `project` parameter to specify which knowledge base to operate on. You can enable `default_project_mode` in your configuration for automatic project selection, or use the `--project` flag when starting the MCP server to constrain operations to a specific project. See [What's New](/whats-new#explicit-project-parameters) for migration details.

### Project Management Tools

## Project Modes

Basic Memory supports three different project modes to accommodate different workflows:

### Multi-Project Mode (Default)

The standard mode for users with multiple knowledge bases:

- **How it works**: AI assistants discover projects using `list_memory_projects()` and `recent_activity()`
- **Project selection**: Users specify which project to work with during conversations
- **Benefits**: Full flexibility to work across multiple projects in one session
- **Best for**: Users managing separate work, personal, and research knowledge bases

**Example workflow:**
```
Assistant: I'll check what projects you have available.
[Calls list_memory_projects()]

Assistant: I see you have 'work', 'personal', and 'research' projects. Which would you like to use?

User: Let's work with the research project

Assistant: Perfect! I'll use the 'research' project for our work.
[Uses project="research" in all subsequent tool calls]
```

### Default Project Mode

**For single-project users who want automatic project selection:**

Enable in `~/.basic-memory/config.json`:
```json
{
  "default_project_mode": true,
  "default_project": "main"
}
```

**Behavior:**
- Tools automatically use your default project when no `project` parameter is specified
- You **can still override** by explicitly passing a different project to tools
- Best for users who primarily work in one project but occasionally need others

**Example:**
```
# With default_project_mode enabled and default_project="main"
write_note("My Note", "Content", "folder")  # Uses "main" project
write_note("Work Note", "Content", "folder", project="work")  # Uses "work" project
```

### Single Project Mode

**For locked, single-project sessions:**

Start MCP server with `--project` flag:
```bash
basic-memory mcp --project work
```

**Behavior:**
- **Locks** the entire MCP session to one project
- The `project` parameter in tool calls is **ignored** - cannot switch projects
- Best for automation, focused sessions, or restricted access scenarios

**Example:**
```bash
# Start locked to "work" project
basic-memory mcp --project work

# All operations use "work" regardless of parameters
write_note("My Note", "Content", "folder")  # Uses "work"
write_note("Note", "Content", "folder", project="personal")  # Still uses "work"!
```

### Project Resolution Hierarchy

When multiple project specifications exist, Basic Memory uses this priority order:

1. **Single Project Mode** (highest priority) - `--project` CLI parameter or `BASIC_MEMORY_MCP_PROJECT` env var
2. **Explicit Parameter** (medium priority) - `project` parameter in tool call
3. **Default Project Mode** (lowest priority) - Automatic default when `default_project_mode=true`

**Quick Comparison:**

| Mode | Can Switch Projects? | Use Case |
|------|---------------------|----------|
| Multi-Project (default) | Yes, via explicit parameters | Managing multiple knowledge bases |
| Default Project Mode | Yes, can override default | Single project with occasional multi-project |
| Single Project Mode | No, locked to one | Automation, security, focused sessions |

</CardGroup>

<Note>
**Deprecated in v0.15.0**: `switch_project()` and `get_current_project()` have been removed. Projects are now specified explicitly via the `project` parameter in each tool call, or automatically resolved using `default_project_mode`. See [What's New](/whats-new#explicit-project-parameters) for details.

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Common Workflows

**Knowledge Creation Flow:**
```
write_note → edit_note (append/prepend) → move_note → view_note
```
*Start with basic note, enhance incrementally, organize, then review*

<details>
<summary>Example conversation</summary>

```
You: "I want to document my thoughts on the new API design"
Claude: I'll create a note for your API design thoughts.
[Uses write_note to create initial note]

You: "Add a section about authentication concerns"
Claude: I'll append an authentication section to your API design note.
[Uses edit_note with append operation]

You: "This should go in my architecture folder"
Claude: I'll move the API design note to your architecture folder.
[Uses move_note to relocate the file]

You: "Show me the final note"
Claude: Here's your complete API design note formatted for easy reading.
[Uses view_note to display formatted artifact]
```
</details>

**Research and Discovery Flow:**
```
search_notes → read_note → build_context → write_note
```
*Find existing knowledge, explore context, create new insights*

<details>
<summary>Example conversation</summary>

```
You: "I'm working on database optimization, what have I learned before?"
Claude: Let me search your knowledge base for database optimization content.
[Uses search_notes to find relevant notes]

You: "Tell me more about that PostgreSQL indexing note"
Claude: I'll read the full PostgreSQL indexing note for you.
[Uses read_note to load complete content and context]

You: "Load the context from my database performance work"
Claude: I'll gather related notes about database performance to build context.
[Uses build_context with memory:// URLs to load related content]

You: "Create a new note combining these insights for my current project"
Claude: I'll create a comprehensive note that synthesizes your database optimization knowledge.
[Uses write_note to capture new insights with full context]
```
</details>

**Project Discovery Flow:**
```
list_memory_projects → recent_activity (discovery mode) → project selection
```
*Discover projects, view cross-project activity, choose working project*

<details>
<summary>Example conversation</summary>

```
You: "What projects do I have available?"
Claude: Here are all your Basic Memory projects with their current status.
[Uses list_memory_projects to show available projects]

You: "Show me recent activity across all projects"
Claude: Here's recent activity across all your projects to help you choose which to work with.
[Uses recent_activity without project parameter for discovery mode]

You: "I want to work with my research project"
Claude: I'll use the 'research' project for our work. All subsequent operations will specify this project.
[Remembers project choice for conversation context]

You: "What have I been working on recently in this project?"
Claude: Here's your recent activity in the research project.
[Uses recent_activity with project="research" parameter]
```
</details>

**Content Organization Flow:**
```
list_directory → search_notes → move_note → list_directory
```
*Explore structure, find content, reorganize, verify changes*

<details>
<summary>Example conversation</summary>

```
You: "Show me what's in my projects folder"
Claude: Here's the structure of your projects folder.
[Uses list_directory to explore folder contents]

You: "Find all notes about the mobile app project"
Claude: I found several notes related to your mobile app project.
[Uses search_notes to locate relevant content]

You: "Move the mobile app notes to a dedicated folder"
Claude: I'll move all mobile app notes to a new 'mobile-app' folder.
[Uses move_note to reorganize content]

You: "Show me the updated folder structure"
Claude: Here's your reorganized projects folder with the new mobile-app directory.
[Uses list_directory to verify the changes]
```
</details>

### Integration Examples

**In Claude Desktop:**
```
You: "What have I been working on lately?"
Claude: [Uses recent_activity prompt for formatted response]

You: "Create a note about today's meeting"
Claude: [Uses write_note tool with semantic structure]

You: "Show me my project documentation as a formatted view"
Claude: [Uses view_note tool to display artifact]
```

**In Development Workflows:**
```
You: "Document today's architecture decisions in my work project"
Claude: [Uses write_note with project="work" parameter and technical context]

You: "Find all my API documentation in the work project and update the authentication section"
Claude: [Uses search_notes with project="work", then edit_note with section replacement]
```

## Error Handling and Best Practices

### Common Tool Parameters

**Identifiers**: Most tools accept flexible identifiers:
- Note titles: `"My Important Note"`
- Permalinks: `"my-important-note"`
- Memory URLs: `"memory://folder/note"`
- File paths: `"folder/note.md"`

**Timeframes**: Natural language supported:
- `"2 days ago"`, `"last week"`, `"today"`
- `"3 months ago"`, `"yesterday"`
- Standard formats: `"7d"`, `"24h"`

**Project Parameters**: Most content tools require project specification:
- Specify which project to operate on: `project="work-docs"`
- Optional if `default_project_mode: true` in configuration
- Automatically resolved in constrained mode (`--project` flag)
- `recent_activity()` supports discovery mode (no project = cross-project view)

## Advanced Features

### Memory URLs

Use `memory://` URLs with `build_context` for intelligent navigation:

```
memory://project-planning          # Load specific note
memory://architecture/*           # Load all architecture notes  
memory://decisions/database-choice # Load specific decision document
```

### Project Management vs Content Tools

Basic Memory tools fall into two categories:

**Project Management Tools** (work globally, no project parameter):
- `list_memory_projects()` - Shows all projects
- `create_memory_project(project_name, project_path)` - Creates new project
- `delete_project(project_name)` - Removes project configuration
- `sync_status()` - Shows status across all projects

**Content Tools** (require project parameter):
- `write_note(title, content, folder, project="...")` - Creates note in specified project
- `search_notes(query, project="...")` - Searches specified project only
- `edit_note(identifier, operation, content, project="...")` - Edits note in specified project
- `read_note(identifier, project="...")` - Reads note from specified project
- `recent_activity(project="...")` - Project-specific activity (or omit for discovery mode)

**Example:**
```python
# Global operations (no project parameter)
list_memory_projects()                              # Shows all projects
create_memory_project("new-project", "~/Documents") # Creates new project

# Project-specific operations (project parameter required)
write_note("My Note", "Content", "folder", project="work")
search_notes("api documentation", project="work")
edit_note("My Note", "append", "More content", project="work")

# Discovery mode (no project = cross-project view)
recent_activity()  # Shows activity across all projects
```
