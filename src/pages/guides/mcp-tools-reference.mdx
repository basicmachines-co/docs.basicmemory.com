## Tool Usage Patterns

### Common Workflows

**Knowledge Creation Flow:**
```
write_note → edit_note (append/prepend) → move_note → view_note
```
*Start with basic note, enhance incrementally, organize, then review*

<details>
<summary>Example conversation</summary>

```
You: "I want to document my thoughts on the new API design"
Claude: I'll create a note for your API design thoughts.
[Uses write_note to create initial note]

You: "Add a section about authentication concerns"
Claude: I'll append an authentication section to your API design note.
[Uses edit_note with append operation]

You: "This should go in my architecture folder"
Claude: I'll move the API design note to your architecture folder.
[Uses move_note to relocate the file]

You: "Show me the final note"
Claude: Here's your complete API design note formatted for easy reading.
[Uses view_note to display formatted artifact]
```
</details>

**Research and Discovery Flow:**
```
search_notes → read_note → build_context → write_note
```
*Find existing knowledge, explore context, create new insights*

<details>
<summary>Example conversation</summary>

```
You: "I'm working on database optimization, what have I learned before?"
Claude: Let me search your knowledge base for database optimization content.
[Uses search_notes to find relevant notes]

You: "Tell me more about that PostgreSQL indexing note"
Claude: I'll read the full PostgreSQL indexing note for you.
[Uses read_note to load complete content and context]

You: "Load the context from my database performance work"
Claude: I'll gather related notes about database performance to build context.
[Uses build_context with memory:// URLs to load related content]

You: "Create a new note combining these insights for my current project"
Claude: I'll create a comprehensive note that synthesizes your database optimization knowledge.
[Uses write_note to capture new insights with full context]
```
</details>

**Project Management Flow:**
```
list_projects → switch_project → recent_activity → get_current_project
```
*Discover projects, switch context, check status, confirm active project*

<details>
<summary>Example conversation</summary>

```
You: "What projects do I have available?"
Claude: Here are all your Basic Memory projects with their current status.
[Uses list_projects to show available projects]

You: "Switch to my work project"
Claude: I've switched to your work project context.
[Uses switch_project to change active project]

You: "What have I been working on recently in this project?"
Claude: Here's your recent activity in the work project.
[Uses recent_activity to show recent changes]

You: "Confirm I'm in the right project"
Claude: You're currently in the 'work' project with 145 notes and 28 recent updates.
[Uses get_current_project to verify active context]
```
</details>

**Content Organization Flow:**
```
list_directory → search_notes → move_note → list_directory
```
*Explore structure, find content, reorganize, verify changes*

<details>
<summary>Example conversation</summary>

```
You: "Show me what's in my projects folder"
Claude: Here's the structure of your projects folder.
[Uses list_directory to explore folder contents]

You: "Find all notes about the mobile app project"
Claude: I found several notes related to your mobile app project.
[Uses search_notes to locate relevant content]

You: "Move the mobile app notes to a dedicated folder"
Claude: I'll move all mobile app notes to a new 'mobile-app' folder.
[Uses move_note to reorganize content]

You: "Show me the updated folder structure"
Claude: Here's your reorganized projects folder with the new mobile-app directory.
[Uses list_directory to verify the changes]
```
</details>

### Integration Examples

**In Claude Desktop:**
```
You: "What have I been working on lately?"
Claude: [Uses recent_activity prompt for formatted response]

You: "Create a note about today's meeting"
Claude: [Uses write_note tool with semantic structure]

You: "Show me my project documentation as a formatted view"
Claude: [Uses view_note tool to display artifact]
```

**In Development Workflows:**
```
You: "Switch to my work project and document today's architecture decisions"
Claude: [Uses switch_project, then write_note with technical context]

You: "Find all my API documentation and update the authentication section"
Claude: [Uses search_notes, then edit_note with section replacement]
```

## Error Handling and Best Practices

### Common Tool Parameters

**Identifiers**: Most tools accept flexible identifiers:
- Note titles: `"My Important Note"`
- Permalinks: `"my-important-note"`
- Memory URLs: `"memory://folder/note"`
- File paths: `"folder/note.md"`

**Timeframes**: Natural language supported:
- `"2 days ago"`, `"last week"`, `"today"`
- `"3 months ago"`, `"yesterday"`
- Standard formats: `"7d"`, `"24h"`

**Project Context**: All tools respect current project context:
- Operations stay within active project boundaries
- Project switching affects all subsequent tool calls
- Use `get_current_project()` to verify context

## Advanced Features

### Memory URLs

Use `memory://` URLs with `build_context` for intelligent navigation:

```
memory://project-planning          # Load specific note
memory://architecture/*           # Load all architecture notes  
memory://decisions/database-choice # Load specific decision document
```

### Cross-Project Operations

Some operations work across project boundaries:

```python
# Project management tools work globally
list_projects()           # Shows all projects
create_project(...)      # Creates new project
set_default_project(...)  # Updates global default

# Other tools respect current project context
search_notes(...)        # Searches current project only
write_note(...)          # Creates note in current project
write_note(..., project="other")   # Creates note in another project
```
