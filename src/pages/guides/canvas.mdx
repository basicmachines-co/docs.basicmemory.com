# Canvas Visualizations

Basic Memory can create visual knowledge maps using Obsidian's Canvas feature. These visualizations help you understand relationships between concepts, map out processes, and visualize your knowledge structure.

## Creating Canvas Visualizations

Ask Claude to create a visualization by describing what you want to map:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
<Card title="Example Requests" icon="chat">
- "Create a canvas visualization of my project components and their relationships."
- "Make a concept map showing the main themes from our discussion about climate change."
- "Can you make a canvas diagram of the perfect pour over method?"
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Types of Visualizations

Basic Memory can create several types of visual maps:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Document Maps" icon="file-text">
Visualize connections between your notes and documents
</Card>
<Card title="Concept Maps" icon="brain">
Create visual representations of ideas and their relationships
</Card>
<Card title="Process Diagrams" icon="workflow">
Map workflows, sequences, and procedures
</Card>
<Card title="Thematic Analysis" icon="tags">
Organize ideas around central themes
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Relationship Networks

Show how different entities relate to each other in your knowledge base.

## Visualization Sources

Claude can create visualizations based on:

### Documents in Your Knowledge Base

```example
You: "Create a canvas showing the connections between my project planning documents"
```

### Conversation Content

```example
You: "Make a canvas visualization of the main points we just discussed"
```

### Search Results

```example
You: "Find all my notes about psychology and create a visual map of the concepts"
```

### Themes and Relationships

```example
You: "Create a visual map showing how different philosophical schools relate to each other"
```

## Visualization Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Request a visualization">
Describe what you want to see by asking Claude to create a canvas
</Step>
<Step title="Claude creates the canvas file">
The canvas file is automatically created in your Basic Memory directory
</Step>
<Step title="Open the file in Obsidian">
View the visualization in Obsidian's Canvas feature
</Step>
<Step title="Refine the visualization">
Ask Claude for adjustments:
- "Could you reorganize the canvas to group related components together?"
- "Please add more detail about the connection between these two concepts."
</Step>
</Steps>

## Technical Details

Behind the scenes, Claude:

<Info>
1. Creates a `.canvas` file in JSON format
2. Adds nodes for each concept or document
3. Creates edges to represent relationships
4. Sets positions for visual clarity
5. Includes any relevant metadata
</Info>

The resulting file is fully compatible with Obsidian's Canvas feature and can be edited directly in Obsidian.

## Tips for Effective Visualizations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Be Specific" icon="target">
Clearly describe what you want to visualize
</Card>
<Card title="Specify Detail Level" icon="zoom-in">
Mention how much detail you need
</Card>
<Card title="Mention Type" icon="shapes">
Specify the visualization type (concept map, process flow, etc.)
</Card>
<Card title="Start Simple" icon="play">
Begin with basic visualizations and ask for refinements
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
**Provide context** about what documents or concepts to include for the best results.
