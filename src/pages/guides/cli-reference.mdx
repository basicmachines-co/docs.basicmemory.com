<Tip>
Cloud users can use all CLI commands after running `bm cloud login`. Commands automatically work with your cloud projects. The local version is free and open-source if you prefer to install on your own machine.
</Tip>

<Note>
You can use the shorter command alias `bm` instead of `basic-memory` for all commands (e.g., `bm cloud login`).
</Note>

## Core Commands

### cloud

Manage Basic Memory Cloud authentication, projects, and file uploads. Requires active subscription.

```bash
# Authenticate with cloud
bm cloud login

# Check authentication status
bm cloud status

# Logout
bm cloud logout

# Upload files to cloud project
bm cloud upload ~/my-notes --project research --create-project

# Set up sync (one-time)
bm cloud setup

# Create a snapshot of your cloud bucket
bm cloud snapshot create "Before major reorganization"

# List all snapshots
bm cloud snapshot list

# Show snapshot details
bm cloud snapshot show <snapshot-id>

# Browse snapshot contents
bm cloud snapshot browse <snapshot-id>

# Delete a snapshot
bm cloud snapshot delete <snapshot-id>
```

<Tip>
For detailed cloud setup, sync workflows, and upload options, see the [Cloud Guide](/guides/cloud) and [Cloud Sync Guide](/guides/cloud-sync).
</Tip>

### import

Imports external knowledge sources with support for project targeting:

```bash
# Claude conversations
basic-memory import claude conversations

# Claude projects
basic-memory import claude projects

# ChatGPT history
basic-memory import chatgpt

# Memory JSON format
basic-memory import memory-json /path/to/memory.json

# Import to specific project
basic-memory --project=work import claude conversations
```



### status

Shows system status information:

```bash
# Basic status check
basic-memory status

# Detailed status
basic-memory status --verbose

# JSON output
basic-memory status --json
```

### project

Manage multiple projects with the new unified database architecture. Projects can now be switched instantly during conversations without restart.

```bash
# List all configured projects with status
basic-memory project list

# Create a new project
basic-memory project add work ~/work-basic-memory

# Create a project using an existing directory (like an Obsidian vault)
basic-memory project add notes ~/Documents/MyObsidianVault

# Set the default project
basic-memory project default work

# Remove a project (doesn't delete files)
basic-memory project remove personal

# Show detailed project statistics
basic-memory project info
```

<Info>
You can also manage projects within an LLM chat via mcp tools.
</Info>


#### Using Projects in Commands

All commands support the `--project` flag to specify which project to use:

```bash
# Run MCP server for a specific project
basic-memory --project=personal mcp
```

#### Local/Cloud Routing Flags

When cloud mode is enabled, you can force routing to local or cloud using these flags:

```bash
# Force local MCP server even when cloud mode is enabled
basic-memory --local mcp

# Force cloud routing
basic-memory --cloud mcp

# These flags work with mcp, project, and tool commands
basic-memory --local project list
basic-memory --cloud tool search-notes --query "api"
```

<Note>
The `--local` flag is useful when you want to work with local files while cloud mode is configured. The `--cloud` flag ensures operations go through the cloud even if local files exist.
</Note>

### tools

Direct access to MCP tools via CLI with new editing and file management capabilities:

```bash
# Create notes
basic-memory tool write-note --title "My Note" --content "Content here"

# Search notes
basic-memory tool search-notes --query "authentication"
```

### help

The full list of commands and help for each can be viewed with the `--help` argument.

```bash
basic-memory --help
```


<Warning>
You need to install Basic Memory via `uv` or `pip` to use the command line tools. See the [Getting Started guide](/getting-started) for installation instructions.
</Warning>

## Using stdin with Basic Memory's `write_note` Tool

The `write-note` tool supports reading content from standard input (stdin), allowing for more flexible workflows when creating or updating notes in your Basic Memory knowledge base.

### Use Cases

This feature is particularly useful for:

1. **Piping output from other commands** directly into Basic Memory notes
2. **Creating notes with multi-line content** without having to escape quotes or special characters
3. **Integrating with AI assistants** like Claude Code that can generate content and pipe it to Basic Memory
4. **Processing text data** from files or other sources

### Basic Usage

#### Method 1: Using a Pipe

You can pipe content from another command into `write_note`:

```bash
# Pipe output of a command into a new note
echo "# My Note\n\nThis is a test note" | basic-memory tool write-note \
--title "Test Note" --folder "notes"

# Pipe output of a file into a new note
cat README.md | basic-memory tool write-note --title "Project README" --folder "documentation"

# Process text through other tools before saving as a note
cat data.txt | grep "important" | basic-memory tool write-note --title "Important Data" --folder "data"
```

#### Method 2: Using Heredoc Syntax

For multi-line content, you can use heredoc syntax:

```bash
# Create a note with heredoc
cat << EOF | basic-memory tool write_note --title "Project Ideas" --folder "projects"
# Project Ideas for Q2

## AI Integration
- Improve recommendation engine
- Add semantic search to product catalog

## Infrastructure
- Migrate to Kubernetes
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
EOF
```

#### Method 3: Input Redirection

You can redirect input from a file:

```bash
# Create a note from file content
basic-memory tool write-note --title "Meeting Notes" --folder "meetings" < meeting_notes.md
```

## Integration with Claude Code

This feature works well with Claude Code in the terminal:

### CLI

In a Claude Code session, let Claude know he can use the basic-memory tools, then he can execute them via the cli:

```bash
echo "# Test Note from Claude\n\nThis is a test note created by Claude to test the stdin functionality." | basic-memory tool write-note --title "Claude Test Note" --folder "test" --tags "test" --tags "claude"
```


```bash
# Stable releases
pip install basic-memory

# Beta/pre-releases
pip install basic-memory --pre

# Latest development builds (auto-published)
pip install basic-memory --pre --force-reinstall

# Check current version
basic-memory --version
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Import Errors

If import fails:

1. Check that the source file is in the correct format
2. Verify permissions on the target directory
3. Use --verbose flag for detailed error information

### Status Issues

If status shows problems:

1. Note any unresolved relations or warnings
2. Restart your MCP Client (e.g. Claude Desktop)
3. Check file permissions if database access errors occur
4. If the errors continue please contact us and we will fix it
