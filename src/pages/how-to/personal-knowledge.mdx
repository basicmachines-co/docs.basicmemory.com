## Best Practices for Personal Knowledge Management

### Organization Strategies

1. **Life domain separation** - Organize by areas like health, relationships, career, finances
2. **Timeline tracking** - Use dates and milestones to see growth over time
3. **Cross-domain connections** - Let AI help you see patterns across different life areas
4. **Regular reflection** - Weekly and monthly reviews to identify trends and insights
5. **Goal integration** - Connect goals across domains to see the whole picture

### AI Collaboration for Personal Growth

1. **Pattern identification** - Let AI analyze your notes to find behavioral patterns
2. **Decision support** - Use your knowledge graph to inform major life decisions
3. **Growth tracking** - AI can help measure progress toward personal development goals
4. **Insight generation** - Regular AI analysis of your personal data for new perspectives
5. **Connection discovery** - Find unexpected links between different life experiences

### Privacy and Personal Boundaries

1. **Choose your level of detail** - Share what feels comfortable for AI analysis
2. **Focus on patterns not specifics** - Use observations and insights rather than raw personal details
3. **Regular review** - Periodically review what you've documented and update privacy preferences
4. **Separate projects** - Use different Basic Memory projects for different privacy levels
5. **Family and relationship boundaries** - Be mindful of others' privacy when documenting shared experiences

## Integration with Life Planning
