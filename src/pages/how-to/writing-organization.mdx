Whether you're writing a novel, blog posts, articles, or any creative content, Basic Memory helps you organize your thoughts, track characters and plots, manage research, and build a comprehensive knowledge base around your writing projects.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up a Writing Project

Create a dedicated space for your writing project:

```bash
# Create your writing project folder
mkdir ~/writing/my-novel

# Initialize Basic Memory project
basic-memory project add my-novel ~/writing/my-novel

# Start organizing your ideas
cd ~/writing/my-novel
```

## Best Practices for Writers

### Organization Tips

1. **Use consistent tagging** - Create a tag system for characters, plots, themes, research
2. **Link everything** - Connect characters to plots, research to scenes, themes to chapters
3. **Daily capture** - Record ideas immediately in your "parking lot" note
4. **Regular reviews** - Weekly review of notes to find connections and gaps
5. **Backup everything** - Use git or cloud storage for your Basic Memory project

### Writing Workflow

1. **Morning pages** - Start each day by reviewing yesterday's notes and planning today
2. **Research integration** - Add research notes immediately when you find new information
3. **Character consistency** - Reference character notes while writing to maintain consistency
4. **Plot tracking** - Update plot notes as your story evolves
5. **Revision notes** - Capture revision ideas as you write, don't stop to edit

### Collaboration

1. **Share memory:// URLs** - Send specific note links to beta readers or writing partners
2. **Collaborative projects** - Use shared Basic Memory projects for co-authored works
3. **Feedback integration** - Create notes from beta reader comments for systematic revision
4. **Writing group prep** - Use notes to prepare for critique sessions
