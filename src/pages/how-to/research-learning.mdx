Basic Memory transforms how you research and learn by enabling AI to create lengthy, detailed notes that are semantically connected. Unlike chat summaries or conversation snippets, these become permanent knowledge assets that build upon each other.

## The Power of AI-Generated Research Notes

### Beyond Conversation Summaries

Instead of short summaries, Basic Memory enables AI to create comprehensive research documents:

```
You: "Research quantum computing and create a detailed note about its implications for cryptography"

AI: [Creates a 2,000+ word note with:]
- Technical foundations and principles
- Current state of quantum computing research
- Specific impacts on encryption algorithms
- Timeline predictions and expert opinions
- Connections to cybersecurity, blockchain, and privacy
- Semantic tags and relations to other topics
```

### Connected Knowledge Building

Each research note becomes part of a growing knowledge web:

```
You: "Now research post-quantum cryptography and connect it to the quantum computing note"

AI: [Creates new detailed note that:]
- Links to previous quantum computing research
- Builds on established concepts
- Identifies gaps and contradictions
- Suggests new research directions
- Creates bidirectional semantic relationships
```

## Research Workflows

# Research Question Evolution - Urban Sustainability

## Initial Question (Too Broad)
"How can cities become more sustainable?"

## Sub-Questions Developed
- [measurement] What metrics best capture 'social cohesion' in urban contexts? #methodology
- [causation] Are emissions reductions due to design or resident selection effects? #causality

## Methodological Considerations
- [approach] Comparative case study across multiple cities #methodology
- [data] Combination of quantitative metrics and qualitative interviews #mixed-methods
- [timeline] Longitudinal study to capture long-term effects #temporal-dimension
- [controls] Account for confounding variables (income, education, preferences) #causal-inference
