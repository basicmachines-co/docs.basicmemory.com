Once you have Basic Memory installed, here's how to make the most of it. This covers everything from creating your first notes to building a comprehensive knowledge graph.

## Basic Memory Workflow

Using Basic Memory follows a natural cycle:

1. **Have conversations** with AI assistants like Claude
2. **Capture knowledge** in Markdown files
3. **Build connections** between pieces of knowledge
4. **Reference your knowledge** in future conversations
5. **Edit files directly** when needed
6. **Sync changes** automatically

## Creating Knowledge

### Through Conversations

To create knowledge during conversations with Claude:

```
You: We've covered several authentication approaches. Could you create a note summarizing what we've discussed?

Claude: I'll create a note summarizing our authentication discussion.
```

This creates a Markdown file in your `~/basic-memory` directory with semantic markup.

<Tip>
You can store your knowledge at any location you want. `~/basic-memory` is the default project location. See [Choosing Where Your Notes Are Saved](/getting-started#choosing-where-your-notes-are-saved) for more information.
</Tip>

### Direct File Creation

You can create files directly:

1. Create a new Markdown file in your `~/basic-memory` directory
2. Add frontmatter with title, type, and optional tags
3. Structure content with observations and relations
4. Save the file

## Using Special Prompts

Basic Memory includes several special prompts that help you leverage your knowledge base more effectively. In apps like
Claude Desktop, these prompts trigger specific tools to search and analyze your knowledge base.

### Continue Conversation

Use this prompt to resume previous topics with full context:

```
"Let's continue our conversation about [topic]"
```

**What happens:**
- Searches your knowledge base for relevant content
- Builds context from related documents
- Resumes with awareness of previous discussions

### Recent Activity

See what you've been working on recently:

```
"What have we been discussing recently?"
```

**What happens:**
- Retrieves recently modified documents
- Summarizes main topics and points
- Offers to continue any discussions

### Search

Find specific information in your knowledge base:

```
"Find information about [topic]"
```

**What happens:**
- Searches across all your documents
- Summarizes key findings
- Offers to explore specific documents

## Working with Memory URLs

Basic Memory uses special `memory://` URLs to reference knowledge:

### URL Formats

```
memory://title                   # Reference by title
memory://folder/title            # Reference by folder and title
memory://permalink               # Reference by permalink
memory://path/relation_type/*    # Follow all relations of type
memory://path/*/target           # Find entities with relations to target
```

### Using Memory URLs

Reference existing knowledge in conversations:

```
You: "Take a look at memory://coffee-brewing-methods and let's discuss improvements"
```

Claude will load that specific document and any related context.

## Building Knowledge Connections

### Creating Relations

Use WikiLink syntax to connect knowledge:

```markdown
- implements [[Authentication System]]
- requires [[Database Schema]]
- relates_to [[Security Guidelines]]
```

### Common Relation Types

- `implements` - One thing implements another
- `requires` - Dependencies
- `relates_to` - General connections
- `part_of` - Hierarchy relationships
- `extends` - Extensions or enhancements
- `pairs_with` - Things that work together

### Adding Observations

Structure facts with semantic categories:

```markdown
- [decision] We chose JWT tokens for stateless auth
- [requirement] Must support 2FA for sensitive operations
- [technique] Use bcrypt for password hashing
- [issue] Rate limiting needed for login attempts
```

## File Organization

### Directory Structure

```
~/basic-memory/
├── projects/          # Project-specific notes
├── decisions/         # Decision records
├── learning/          # Learning notes and research
├── meetings/          # Meeting notes
└── archive/           # Archived content
```

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive filenames
- Group related content in folders
- Include dates in time-sensitive notes
- Archive old content regularly

### Controlling What Gets Indexed

**New in v0.15.0:** Basic Memory respects `.gitignore` patterns to automatically skip sensitive files and skip indexing files if needed.

**How it works:**

Basic Memory combines ignore patterns from two sources:

1. **Global patterns**: `~/.basic-memory/.bmignore` (applied to all projects)
2. **Project patterns**: `{project}/.gitignore` (applied to specific project)

**Example `.gitignore`:**
```gitignore
# Sensitive files
.env
.env.*
*.key
credentials.json

# Build artifacts
node_modules/
__pycache__/
dist/
build/

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

**Benefits:**
- **Security**: Prevents indexing sensitive files like `.env` or API keys
- **Performance**: Skips unnecessary files like `node_modules/` or build outputs
- **Cleaner knowledge base**: Ignores OS and editor files

Files matching these patterns are automatically skipped during index sync and never indexed in your knowledge base.

## Multi-Project Features

### Project Management

```bash
# Create new project
basic-memory project add work ~/work-notes

# List all projects
basic-memory project list
```

### Project Selection Workflow

**New in v0.15.0:** At the start of each conversation, the AI will:
1. Check your available projects
2. Suggest the most active project based on recent activity
3. Ask which project to use for this conversation
4. Remember your choice throughout the session

**Example conversation:**
```
You: "Let's work on documentation"

Claude: I see you have 3 projects: main, work-notes, personal
Your most active project is work-notes
Should I use work-notes for this task?

You: "Yes, let's use work-notes"
```

**For single-project users:**

If you only use one project, you can skip the selection prompt. Add this to `~/.basic-memory/config.json`:

```json
{
  "default_project": "main",
  "default_project_mode": true
}
```

With this enabled, the AI uses your default project automatically without asking. You can still override this by explicitly specifying a different project in tool calls.

### Single Project Mode

For focused work sessions or automation, you can lock the MCP server to a specific project:

```bash
# Start MCP server constrained to specific project
basic-memory mcp --project work-notes
```

This **locks** the entire MCP session to one project - the `project` parameter in tool calls will be ignored.

**When to use:**
- Automation workflows that should only access one project
- Focused work sessions where you want to prevent accidental cross-project operations
- Team environments with project-specific access

**Key difference from Default Project Mode:**
- **Single Project Mode**: Locks session to one project, cannot switch
- **Default Project Mode**: Uses default automatically, but can still switch projects

<Warning>
Moving notes from one project to another is not currently supported. The easiest
thing to do is to either move the note yourself or write a new note, then delete
the old note.
</Warning>

### Enhanced Editing

**Incremental editing** instead of rewriting:

```
You: "Add a troubleshooting section to my setup guide"
Claude: [Uses edit_note to append new section]
```

**Smart file organization**:

```
You: "Move my old meeting notes to the archive folder"
Claude: [Uses move_note with database consistency]
```

### Enhanced Search

Search now includes frontmatter tags:

```markdown
---
title: Coffee Notes
tags: [brewing, equipment, techniques]
---
```

Tags are searchable: `"Find my brewing notes"` will find this document.

## Syncing and Updates

### Real-time Sync (Default)

Basic Memory automatically syncs file changes in real-time. No manual sync needed.

### Checking Status

```bash
# View sync status
basic-memory status

# View project information
basic-memory project info
```

## Integration Tips

### With Obsidian

1. Open your `~/basic-memory` directory in Obsidian
2. Use graph view to see connections
3. Edit files directly in Obsidian
4. Changes are synced in real time. Ask the AI to read a note to see changes.

### With Git

```bash
cd ~/basic-memory
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial knowledge base"
```

Basic Memory files are git-friendly and work well with version control.

### With Other Editors

Basic Memory uses standard Markdown files that work with:

- VS Code with Markdown extensions
- Typora for rich text editing
- Any text editor for quick edits
- Web editors for remote access

## Configuration

- Values: `true`, `false`
- See [Cloud Guide](/guides/cloud) for details


### Configuration Priority

Settings are applied in this order (highest to lowest priority):

1. **Environment variables** (e.g., `BASIC_MEMORY_LOG_LEVEL`)
2. **Config file** (`~/.basic-memory/config.json`)
3. **Default values** (hardcoded in application)

Example:
```bash
# Config file has: "log_level": "INFO"
# Environment has: BASIC_MEMORY_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
# Result: DEBUG is used (environment wins)
```

### Editing Configuration

**Via config file:**
```bash
# Edit configuration
vim ~/.basic-memory/config.json

# Restart MCP server for changes to take effect
# (Claude Desktop, VS Code, etc.)
```

**Via CLI:**
```bash
# Set default project
basic-memory project default work

# View all projects
basic-memory project list

# Check current configuration
cat ~/.basic-memory/config.json
```

**Via environment:**
```bash
# Temporary (current session)
export BASIC_MEMORY_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
basic-memory status

# Permanent (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
echo 'export BASIC_MEMORY_DEFAULT_PROJECT_MODE=true' >> ~/.bashrc
```

<Note>
After changing configuration, restart your MCP client (Claude Desktop, VS Code, etc.) for changes to take effect.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Changes not syncing:**
- Check `basic-memory status` for sync status
- Verify file permissions
- Reset the database with `basic-memory reset`

**Claude can't find knowledge:**
- Confirm files are in the correct project directory
- Check frontmatter formatting
- Try `memory://` URLs for direct references

**Performance issues:**
- Large knowledge bases may need optimization
- Use `basic-memory project info` to check database size
- Consider archiving old content
