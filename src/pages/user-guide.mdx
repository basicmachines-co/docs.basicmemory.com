Once you have Basic Memory installed, here's how to make the most of it. This covers everything from creating your first notes to building a comprehensive knowledge graph.

## Basic Memory Workflow

Using Basic Memory follows a natural cycle:

1. **Have conversations** with AI assistants like Claude
2. **Capture knowledge** in Markdown files
3. **Build connections** between pieces of knowledge
4. **Reference your knowledge** in future conversations
5. **Edit files directly** when needed
6. **Sync changes** automatically

## Creating Knowledge

### Through Conversations

To create knowledge during conversations with Claude:

```
You: We've covered several authentication approaches. Could you create a note summarizing what we've discussed?

Claude: I'll create a note summarizing our authentication discussion.
```

This creates a Markdown file in your `~/basic-memory` directory with semantic markup.

<Tip>
You can store your knowledge at any location you want. `~/basic-memory` is the default project location.
</Tip>

### Direct File Creation

You can create files directly:

1. Create a new Markdown file in your `~/basic-memory` directory
2. Add frontmatter with title, type, and optional tags
3. Structure content with observations and relations
4. Save the file

## Using Special Prompts

Basic Memory includes several special prompts that help you leverage your knowledge base more effectively. In apps like
Claude Desktop, these prompts trigger specific tools to search and analyze your knowledge base.

### Continue Conversation

Use this prompt to resume previous topics with full context:

```
"Let's continue our conversation about [topic]"
```

**What happens:**
- Searches your knowledge base for relevant content
- Builds context from related documents
- Resumes with awareness of previous discussions

### Recent Activity

See what you've been working on recently:

```
"What have we been discussing recently?"
```

**What happens:**
- Retrieves recently modified documents
- Summarizes main topics and points
- Offers to continue any discussions

### Search

Find specific information in your knowledge base:

```
"Find information about [topic]"
```

**What happens:**
- Searches across all your documents
- Summarizes key findings
- Offers to explore specific documents

## Working with Memory URLs

Basic Memory uses special `memory://` URLs to reference knowledge:

### URL Formats

```
memory://title                   # Reference by title
memory://folder/title            # Reference by folder and title
memory://permalink               # Reference by permalink
memory://path/relation_type/*    # Follow all relations of type
memory://path/*/target           # Find entities with relations to target
```

### Using Memory URLs

Reference existing knowledge in conversations:

```
You: "Take a look at memory://coffee-brewing-methods and let's discuss improvements"
```

Claude will load that specific document and any related context.

## Building Knowledge Connections

### Creating Relations

Use WikiLink syntax to connect knowledge:

```markdown
- implements [[Authentication System]]
- requires [[Database Schema]]
- relates_to [[Security Guidelines]]
```

### Common Relation Types

- `implements` - One thing implements another
- `requires` - Dependencies
- `relates_to` - General connections
- `part_of` - Hierarchy relationships
- `extends` - Extensions or enhancements
- `pairs_with` - Things that work together

### Adding Observations

Structure facts with semantic categories:

```markdown
- [decision] We chose JWT tokens for stateless auth
- [requirement] Must support 2FA for sensitive operations
- [technique] Use bcrypt for password hashing
- [issue] Rate limiting needed for login attempts
```

## File Organization

### Directory Structure

```
~/basic-memory/
├── projects/          # Project-specific notes
├── decisions/         # Decision records
├── learning/          # Learning notes and research
├── meetings/          # Meeting notes
└── archive/           # Archived content
```

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive filenames
- Group related content in folders
- Include dates in time-sensitive notes
- Archive old content regularly

## Multi-Project Features

### Project Management

```bash
# Create new project
basic-memory project add work ~/work-notes

# Switch projects instantly during conversations
# You can say: "Switch to my work project"

# List all projects
basic-memory project list
```

### Enhanced Editing

**Incremental editing** instead of rewriting:

```
You: "Add a troubleshooting section to my setup guide"
Claude: [Uses edit_note to append new section]
```

**Smart file organization**:

```
You: "Move my old meeting notes to the archive folder"
Claude: [Uses move_note with database consistency]
```

### Enhanced Search

Search now includes frontmatter tags:

```markdown
---
title: Coffee Notes
tags: [brewing, equipment, techniques]
---
```

Tags are searchable: `"Find my brewing notes"` will find this document.

## Syncing and Updates

### Real-time Sync (Default)

Basic Memory automatically syncs file changes in real-time. No manual sync needed.

### Manual Sync

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# Sync once
basic-memory sync

# Disable auto-sync and sync manually
basic-memory sync --no-watch
```

### Checking Status

```bash
# View sync status
basic-memory status

# View project information
basic-memory project info
```

## Integration Tips

### With Obsidian

1. Open your `~/basic-memory` directory in Obsidian
2. Use graph view to see connections
3. Edit files directly in Obsidian
4. Changes are synced in real time. Ask the AI to read a note to see changes.

### With Git

```bash
cd ~/basic-memory
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial knowledge base"
```

Basic Memory files are git-friendly and work well with version control.

### With Other Editors

Basic Memory uses standard Markdown files that work with:

- VS Code with Markdown extensions
- Typora for rich text editing
- Any text editor for quick edits
- Web editors for remote access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Changes not syncing:**
- Check `basic-memory status` for sync status
- Restart sync with `basic-memory sync --watch`
- Verify file permissions

**Claude can't find knowledge:**
- Confirm files are in the correct project directory
- Check frontmatter formatting
- Try `memory://` URLs for direct references

**Performance issues:**
- Large knowledge bases may need optimization
- Use `basic-memory project info` to check database size
- Consider archiving old content

### Getting Help

```bash
# View all available commands
basic-memory --help

# Get help for specific commands
basic-memory sync --help
basic-memory project --help
```

## Best Practices

### Knowledge Creation

1. **Be descriptive** - Use clear titles and rich content
2. **Add context** - Include background and reasoning
3. **Create connections** - Link related concepts
4. **Use categories** - Structure observations semantically
5. **Review and refine** - Edit AI-generated content for accuracy

### Workflow

1. **Start conversations contextually** - Use special prompts
2. **Build incrementally** - Add to existing notes rather than creating duplicates
3. **Organize regularly** - Move old content to appropriate folders
4. **Cross-reference** - Link new content to existing knowledge
5. **Switch projects** - Use different projects for different contexts

### Long-term Maintenance

1. **Archive old content** - Keep active knowledge base focused
2. **Refactor connections** - Update relations as knowledge evolves
3. **Regular reviews** - Periodically review and update key documents
4. **Backup regularly** - Use git or other backup solutions
5. **Share appropriately** - Use git for collaboration when needed
