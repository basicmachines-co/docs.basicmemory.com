## Basic Memory Cloud

<Tip>
[Basic Memory Cloud](/guides/cloud) is live! Now accessible from everywhere, in the Cloud. [Sign up ->](https://basicmemory.com/beta) with a 7 day free trial.
</Tip>

Work with your knowledge base across multiple devices using cloud sync and storage.

## v0.18.0

Basic Memory v0.18.0 adds directory operations to MCP tools, local/cloud routing control, and cloud snapshots.

<Info>
**Key improvements:**
- Move and delete entire directories with MCP tools
- New `--local` and `--cloud` flags for routing control
- Cloud snapshot commands for backup and recovery
- Improved cloud mode stability
</Info>

### Directory Operations

MCP tools now support bulk directory operations:

**Move entire directories:**
```python
# Move a folder and all its contents
move_note("old-projects", "archive/old-projects", is_directory=True)
```

**Delete directories recursively:**
```python
# Remove a folder and all contained files
delete_note("temp-folder", is_directory=True)
```

This enables efficient bulk organization of your knowledge base without moving files one at a time.

### Local/Cloud Routing Flags

New CLI flags on `tools` commands give you explicit control over where operations are routed:

```bash
# Force local routing when cloud mode is enabled
bm tools search-notes --query "api" --local

# Force cloud routing
bm tools recent-activity --cloud
```

Useful when you want to work with local files while cloud mode is configured, or ensure operations go through the cloud.

### Cloud Snapshots

<Note>
Cloud snapshots require a Basic Memory Cloud subscription.
</Note>

Create and manage point-in-time snapshots of your cloud bucket:

```bash
# Create a snapshot before major changes
bm cloud snapshot create "Before reorganization"

# List all snapshots
bm cloud snapshot list

# Browse snapshot contents
bm cloud snapshot browse <snapshot-id>

# Show snapshot details
bm cloud snapshot show <snapshot-id>
```

Snapshots provide a safety net for major reorganizations or experiments with your knowledge base.

See the [complete v0.18.0 changelog](/changelog) for full details.

## v0.17.0

Basic Memory v0.17.0 completes the API v2 migration, adds auto-formatting, and improves CLI stability.

<Info>
**Key improvements:**
- All MCP tools now use API v2 endpoints for improved performance
- Auto-format files on save with built-in Python formatter
- CLI commands no longer hang on exit
- Anonymous usage telemetry (Homebrew-style opt-out)
</Info>

### API v2 Migration Complete

Phase 2 of the API v2 migration is complete. All MCP tools now use the new v2 endpoints, providing:

- **Improved performance** - Optimized endpoints for faster responses
- **Better scalability** - Foundation for future API enhancements
- **Backward compatibility** - Existing integrations continue to work

### Auto-Format on Save

Basic Memory now includes a built-in Python formatter that automatically formats files when saved:

```bash
# Files are automatically formatted on save
# No external tools required
```

This ensures consistent formatting across your knowledge base without needing to configure external formatters.

### CLI Stability Improvements

Several improvements make the CLI more reliable:

- **No more hanging** - Commands exit cleanly after completion
- **Rclone version detection** - Automatically checks for `--create-empty-src-dirs` support
- **Better ChatGPT import** - Handles null titles gracefully

### Anonymous Telemetry

Basic Memory now includes opt-out anonymous telemetry (similar to Homebrew) to help improve the product:

- No personal data collected
- Privacy-respecting design
- Easy to disable via environment variable

```bash
# Disable telemetry
export BASIC_MEMORY_NO_TELEMETRY=1
```

See the [complete v0.17.0 changelog](/latest-releases) for full details.

## v0.16.0

Basic Memory v0.16.0 focuses on cloud sync reliability, Windows platform support, and overall system robustness.

<Info>
**Key improvements:**
- Simplified and more reliable cloud sync with project-scoped rclone configuration
- Significantly improved Windows compatibility with Unicode fixes
- Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading sync failures
- Better memory management for large knowledge bases
- Enhanced cloud upload controls and debugging
</Info>

### Cloud Sync Enhancements

**Simplified project-scoped sync:**
The cloud sync architecture has been simplified with project-level rclone configuration, making sync operations more reliable and easier to troubleshoot.

**What you'll experience:**
- More consistent sync behavior across different environments
- Better error messages when sync issues occur
- Improved sync performance and reliability

**Background sync operations:**
Long-running sync operations can now run in the background, preventing API timeouts and improving overall system responsiveness.

```bash
# Sync runs in background, returns immediately
bm project bisync --name main --background
```

**Circuit breaker for resilience:**
Automatic failure recovery prevents cascading errors during sync operations. Transient network issues no longer cause complete sync failures.

**Enhanced upload controls:**
```bash
# Verbose logging for troubleshooting
bm cloud upload ~/notes --project main --verbose

# Bypass gitignore when needed
bm cloud upload ~/all-files --project archive --no-gitignore
```

### Windows Platform Support

v0.16.0 includes major improvements for Windows users:

**Unicode encoding fixes:**
- Resolves terminal encoding issues on Windows
- Better handling of international characters in filenames and content
- ASCII characters replace Unicode symbols for better compatibility

**Improved rclone integration:**
- Better path handling for Windows filesystem conventions
- More reliable cloud sync on Windows
- Fixed edge cases with Windows-specific path separators

### Reliability Improvements

**Memory optimization for large projects:**
Prevents out-of-memory errors when syncing large knowledge bases. The sync process now handles projects with thousands of files efficiently.

**Better YAML frontmatter handling:**
- Automatically quotes string values to handle special characters
- Normalizes frontmatter types to prevent parsing errors
- More robust handling of edge cases in markdown files

**Improved sync accuracy:**
Uses filesystem timestamps instead of database operation times for better detection of external file modifications. This makes sync more reliable when editing files in external editors like Obsidian or VS Code.

### API & Tool Improvements

**Clearer write_note parameter:**
The `entity_type` parameter has been renamed to `note_type` for better clarity and consistency.

```python
# v0.16.0 (new)
write_note("My Note", "Content", "folder", note_type="note")

# v0.15.x (old, still supported)
write_note("My Note", "Content", "folder", entity_type="note")
```

**Safer project deletion:**
```bash
# Delete project configuration only (preserves files)
bm project remove work

# Delete project AND all notes
bm project remove work --delete-notes
```

**Better error handling:**
- Graceful handling of malformed YAML frontmatter
- Better recovery from missing or incomplete metadata
- More informative error messages

### Bug Fixes

- Archive files (zip, tar, gz) automatically excluded from cloud uploads
- Duplicate headers no longer created when replacing note sections
- Deleted projects won't be recreated by background sync
- Better handling of empty or null titles in frontmatter
- Database constraint violations resolved during sync operations

See the [complete v0.16.0 changelog](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

## v0.15.0

Basic Memory v0.15.0 introduces Cloud projects, multi-project conversation improvements, performance optimizations, and Python 3.13 support.

#### Learn More

See the [Basic Memory Cloud](/guides/cloud-cli) guide for complete documentation including:
- Using cloud mode via the command line
- Managing projects
- Uploading notes
- Viewing notes via the notes web ui

### Multi-Project Conversations

AI assistants now ask which project to use at the start of conversations.

#### What You'll Experience

When starting a new conversation, the AI will:

1. Check for available projects
2. Suggest the most active project based on recent activity
3. Ask which project to use
4. Remember your choice throughout the conversation

**Example conversation:**
```
You: "Let's work on documentation"

Claude: I see you have 3 projects: main, work-docs, creative-writing
Your most active project is work-docs (15 recent updates)
Should I use work-docs for this task?

You: "Yes"

Claude: I'll use work-docs for this session.
[All subsequent operations use work-docs project]
```

#### Default Project Setup

If you only use one project, enable automatic project selection:

**Configuration** (`~/.basic-memory/config.json`):
```json
{
  "default_project": "main",
  "default_project_mode": true
}
```

With this enabled:
- AI uses your default project automatically when no project is specified
- You can still override by explicitly passing a different project to tools
- Suitable for users who primarily work in one project

#### Single Project Mode

Lock an MCP session to a specific project using the `--project` flag:

```bash
basic-memory mcp --project work-notes
```

**Key behavior:** All operations in this session use the specified project - the `project` parameter in tool calls is ignored. Useful for automation, security, and focused work sessions where you want to prevent accidental cross-project operations.

#### What Changed from v0.14.x

**Removed tools:**
- `switch_project()` - no longer available
- `get_current_project()` - no longer available

**New behavior:**
- AI asks which project to use at conversation start
- Project selection remembered throughout session
- `list_memory_projects()` shows available projects with activity suggestions
- `recent_activity()` provides cross-project discovery

All MCP tools now accept an explicit `project` parameter. See [Technical Information](/technical/technical-information) for architecture details.

### Performance Improvements

v0.15.0 includes significant performance optimizations across API operations, database queries, and startup processes.

#### API Optimizations

API response times improved 3-4x through query optimization and batch loading. The `read_note` endpoint now completes in 75ms instead of 250ms, while `build_context` operations with depth=2 run in 320ms instead of 1200ms.

**What changed:**
- Single optimized queries replace multiple separate database calls
- Batch loading eliminates N+1 query problems
- Eager loading strategies reduce round trips

Database queries for typical MCP tool calls dropped from 15-20 queries to 3-5 queries (75% reduction).

#### Startup Performance

The MCP server now starts instantly (&lt;1 second) regardless of knowledge base size.
Previously, large knowledge bases with 1000+ entities could have slow startup times.

**Background relation resolution:**
- Entity relations resolve in background threads
- Server accepts requests immediately on startup
- Relations complete asynchronously without blocking operations

#### Database Performance

SQLite now uses Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode by default, enabling concurrent reads and writes. This feature is particularly relevant to Windows users.

**Performance gains:**
- 2-3x faster write operations
- Readers don't block writers (and vice versa)
- Bulk operations complete in seconds instead of minutes

### Platform Support

#### Python 3.13

Basic Memory now supports Python 3.13. All dependencies have been verified compatible, and Python 3.13 is included in the CI test matrix.

**Supported versions:** Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13

#### .gitignore Support

The sync process now respects `.gitignore` patterns, automatically skipping files during synchronization.

**What you'll notice:**
- Sensitive files (`.env`, credentials) excluded from sync
- Build artifacts (`node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`) not indexed
- OS and editor files (`.DS_Store`, `.vscode/`) ignored

Create a `.gitignore` in your project root to control which files are synced.
See [Controlling What gets synced](user-guide#controlling-what-gets-synced) in the user guide.

### Bug Fixes

**v0.15.0** resolves numerous bugs related to entity conflicts, URL handling, file operations, and platform compatibility.

**Key fixes:**
- Entity upsert conflicts resolved through database-level conflict handling
- `memory://` URLs with underscores now properly normalized to hyphens
- `move_note` automatically handles file extensions (works with or without `.md`)
- `.env` file auto-loading removed for compatibility with code repos using env files
- Minimum timeframe enforcement prevents timezone edge cases
- DateTime fields include proper JSON schema format for MCP validation

See the [complete changelog](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) or the [full v0.15.0 release notes](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/releases/tag/v0.15.0).
