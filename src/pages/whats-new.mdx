## üóÑÔ∏è Unified Database Architecture

**Single app-level database for better performance and project management:**

### Automatic Migration

**Seamless upgrade from v0.12.x:**

After upgrading, Basic Memory will re-index all your project notes into a single project. Basic Memory uses your files
as the source of truth, so there is no risk of data loss. You can see the status any time.

```
You: what is the sync status?

Claude:

**Current Status**: üîÑ Syncing 1 projects (231/331 files, 70%)
**System Ready**: üîÑ Processing

üîÑ **File synchronization in progress**

Basic Memory is automatically processing all configured projects and building knowledge graphs.
This typically takes 1-3 minutes depending on the amount of content.

**Currently Processing:**
- **main**: Processing new files (231/331, 70%)

**What's happening:**
- Scanning and indexing markdown files
- Building entity and relationship graphs
- Setting up full-text search indexes
- Processing file changes and updates

**What you can do:**
- Wait for automatic processing to complete - no action needed
- Use this tool again to check progress
- Simple operations may work already
- All projects will be available once sync finishes

**Note**: All configured projects will be automatically synced during startup.
You don't need to manually switch projects - Basic Memory handles this for you.
```

### Better Project Isolation

**Secure project boundaries:**
```
You: "Switch to work-notes project"

You: "Search for client information"
Claude: [Searches only within work-notes project]
Found 3 client-related notes in work-notes:
‚Ä¢ Client Requirements Document
‚Ä¢ Meeting Notes - Client Kickoff
‚Ä¢ Client Feedback Analysis

[Personal project notes remain completely isolated]
```
