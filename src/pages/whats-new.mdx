## v0.15.0

Basic Memory v0.15.0 introduces cloud sync, multi-project conversation improvements, performance optimizations, and Python 3.13 support.


### Basic Memory Cloud

<Info>
Basic Memory Cloud is currently in invite-only beta. Sign up for Early Access on [basicmemory.com](https://basicmemory.com).
</Info>

Work with your knowledge base across multiple devices using cloud sync and storage.

#### Learn More

See the [Cloud Guide](/guides/cloud-cli) for complete documentation including:
- Conflict resolution strategies
- File filtering with `.bmignore`
- Multi-device workflows
- Troubleshooting and performance tips

### Multi-Project Conversations

AI assistants now ask which project to use at the start of conversations.

#### What You'll Experience

When starting a new conversation, the AI will:

1. Check for available projects
2. Suggest the most active project based on recent activity
3. Ask which project to use
4. Remember your choice throughout the conversation

**Example conversation:**
```
You: "Let's work on documentation"

Claude: I see you have 3 projects: main, work-docs, creative-writing
Your most active project is work-docs (15 recent updates)
Should I use work-docs for this task?

You: "Yes"

Claude: I'll use work-docs for this session.
[All subsequent operations use work-docs project]
```

#### Default Project Setup

If you only use one project, enable automatic project selection:

**Configuration** (`~/.basic-memory/config.json`):
```json
{
  "default_project": "main",
  "default_project_mode": true
}
```

With this enabled:
- AI uses your default project automatically
- No project selection prompt
- Suitable for single knowledge base workflows

#### Single Project Mode

Lock an MCP session to a specific project using the `--project` flag:

```bash
basic-memory mcp --project work-notes
```

All operations in this session use the specified project. Useful for automation and focused work sessions.

#### What Changed from v0.14.x

**Removed tools:**
- `switch_project()` - no longer available
- `get_current_project()` - no longer available

**New behavior:**
- AI asks which project to use at conversation start
- Project selection remembered throughout session
- `list_memory_projects()` shows available projects with activity suggestions
- `recent_activity()` provides cross-project discovery

All MCP tools now accept an explicit `project` parameter. See [Technical Information](/technical/technical-information) for architecture details.

### Performance Improvements

v0.15.0 includes significant performance optimizations across API operations, database queries, and startup processes.

#### API Optimizations

API response times improved 3-4x through query optimization and batch loading. The `read_note` endpoint now completes in 75ms instead of 250ms, while `build_context` operations with depth=2 run in 320ms instead of 1200ms.

**What changed:**
- Single optimized queries replace multiple separate database calls
- Batch loading eliminates N+1 query problems
- Eager loading strategies reduce round trips

Database queries for typical MCP tool calls dropped from 15-20 queries to 3-5 queries (75% reduction).

#### Startup Performance

The MCP server now starts instantly (&lt;1 second) regardless of knowledge base size.
Previously, large knowledge bases with 1000+ entities could have slow startup times.

**Background relation resolution:**
- Entity relations resolve in background threads
- Server accepts requests immediately on startup
- Relations complete asynchronously without blocking operations

#### Database Performance

SQLite now uses Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode by default, enabling concurrent reads and writes. This feature is particularly relevant to Windows users.

**Performance gains:**
- 2-3x faster write operations
- Readers don't block writers (and vice versa)
- Bulk operations complete in seconds instead of minutes

### Platform Support

#### Python 3.13

Basic Memory now supports Python 3.13. All dependencies have been verified compatible, and Python 3.13 is included in the CI test matrix.

**Supported versions:** Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13

#### .gitignore Support

The sync process now respects `.gitignore` patterns, automatically skipping files during synchronization.

**What you'll notice:**
- Sensitive files (`.env`, credentials) excluded from sync
- Build artifacts (`node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`) not indexed
- OS and editor files (`.DS_Store`, `.vscode/`) ignored

Create a `.gitignore` in your project root to control which files are synced.
See [Controlling What gets synced](user-guide#controlling-what-gets-synced) in the user guide.

### Bug Fixes

**v0.15.0** resolves numerous bugs related to entity conflicts, URL handling, file operations, and platform compatibility.

**Key fixes:**
- Entity upsert conflicts resolved through database-level conflict handling
- `memory://` URLs with underscores now properly normalized to hyphens
- `move_note` automatically handles file extensions (works with or without `.md`)
- `.env` file auto-loading removed for compatibility with code repos using env files
- Minimum timeframe enforcement prevents timezone edge cases
- DateTime fields include proper JSON schema format for MCP validation

title: Coffee Brewing Methods
tags: [coffee, brewing, equipment, chemex]
---

# Coffee Brewing Methods
Pour-over techniques for better coffee...
```
*Search for "chemex" would find nothing*

**v0.13.0** - Tags are now indexed and searchable:
```

```

### Unified Database Architecture

**Single app-level database for better performance and project management:**

#### Automatic Migration

**Seamless upgrade from v0.12.x:**

After upgrading, Basic Memory will re-index all your project notes into a single project. Basic Memory uses your files
as the source of truth, so there is no risk of data loss. You can see the status any time.

```
You: what is the sync status?

Claude:

**Current Status**: üîÑ Syncing 1 projects (231/331 files, 70%)
**System Ready**: üîÑ Processing

üîÑ **File synchronization in progress**

Basic Memory is automatically processing all configured projects and building knowledge graphs.
This typically takes 1-3 minutes depending on the amount of content.

**Currently Processing:**
- **main**: Processing new files (231/331, 70%)

**What's happening:**
- Scanning and indexing markdown files
- Building entity and relationship graphs
- Setting up full-text search indexes
- Processing file changes and updates

**What you can do:**
- Wait for automatic processing to complete - no action needed
- Use this tool again to check progress
- Simple operations may work already
- All projects will be available once sync finishes

**Note**: All configured projects will be automatically synced during startup.
You don't need to manually switch projects - Basic Memory handles this for you.
```

#### Better Project Isolation

**Secure project boundaries:**
```
You: "Switch to work-notes project"
Claude: ‚úì Switched to work-notes

You: "Search for client information"
Claude: [Searches only within work-notes project]
Found 3 client-related notes in work-notes:
‚Ä¢ Client Requirements Document
‚Ä¢ Meeting Notes - Client Kickoff
‚Ä¢ Client Feedback Analysis

[Personal project notes remain completely isolated]
```
