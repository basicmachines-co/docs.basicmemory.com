# v0.15.0

Basic Memory v0.15.0 introduces cloud synchronization, performance improvements, security enhancements, and Python 3.13 support.

## Cloud Features

<Warning>
Cloud features require an active subscription. Visit [basicmemory.com](https://basicmemory.com) for subscription options.
</Warning>

### Cloud Authentication

JWT-based authentication with automatic token refresh:

```bash
# Login
basic-memory cloud login

# Logout
basic-memory cloud logout
```

Credentials stored in `~/.basic-memory/cloud_auth.json`. Tokens auto-refresh for 24-hour sessions.

### Bidirectional Sync

Sync local files with cloud using rclone bisync:

```bash
# Sync current project
basic-memory cloud sync

# Sync specific project
basic-memory --project=work cloud sync
```

**Features:**
- Bidirectional synchronization
- Conflict detection and resolution
- .gitignore pattern support
- Checksum validation

### Cloud Mount

Mount cloud storage as local filesystem:

```bash
# Mount with default profile
basic-memory cloud mount

# Mount with specific profile
basic-memory cloud mount --profile fast
basic-memory cloud mount --profile safe
```

**Performance profiles:**
- `fast`: 5s cache, optimized for speed
- `balanced`: 10-15s cache (default)
- `safe`: 15s+ cache, optimized for integrity

See [Cloud CLI Guide](/guides/cloud-cli) for complete documentation.

## Performance Improvements

### API Optimizations

SPEC-11 performance improvements:
- Optimized database queries
- Reduced response times
- Background processing for relations

### Background Relation Resolution

Non-blocking startup with background processing:
- Application starts immediately
- Relations resolved in background
- No cold start delays

### Non-Blocking Sync

Thread pool for sync operations:
- Improved responsiveness
- No blocking during file synchronization
- Faster overall performance

## Security Enhancements

### Configuration Security

Removed .env file loading:
- Eliminates unintended environment variable loading
- Improved configuration isolation
- Better security posture

### .gitignore Integration

Sync respects .gitignore patterns:
- Build artifacts excluded automatically
- Temporary files not synced
- Reduced sync overhead

## Platform Support

### Python 3.13

Full compatibility with Python 3.13:
- Updated dependencies
- CI testing on Python 3.13
- Performance improvements from newer Python version

### ChatGPT Tools

ChatGPT-specific tools for search and fetch operations.

## Architecture

### Stateless MCP Tools

SPEC-6 stateless architecture implementation:
- Improved cloud deployment scalability
- Stateless tool design
- Better multi-instance support

### Optional Permalinks

Configuration flag to disable permalink generation:

```json
{
  "disable_permalinks": true
}
```

Useful for workflows that don't require permalink-based navigation.

## Bug Fixes

### Permalink Collision Prevention

Strict link resolution during entity creation prevents data loss from fuzzy matching similar file paths.

### Memory URL Normalization

Consistent underscore handling in memory:// URLs for reliable knowledge graph navigation.

### Database Upsert

Database-level conflict resolution reduces application complexity and improves reliability.

### Timeframe Enforcement

Minimum timeframe validation for operations prevents edge case errors.

## Project Modes

<Warning>
**Note**: The `switch_project()` and `get_current_project()` tools have been removed.
</Warning>

### Multi-Project Mode
**Default behavior** (same as previous versions)

- AI discovers projects using `list_memory_projects()`
- User specifies which project to work with
- Content tool use the `project` parameter
- For users with multiple knowledge bases
- AI remembers which project you are currently using

**Example:**
```
You: "What projects do I have?"
Claude: [Uses list_memory_projects()]
Available projects: main, work-notes, creative-writing

You: "Create a character profile in creative-writing"
Claude: [Uses write_note(title="Protagonist", project="creative-writing")]
‚úì Created character profile in creative-writing project
```

### Default Project Mode

Configure Basic Memory to use only a single default project for all notes.

**Simplified single-project usage** (new)
- Tools automatically use default project
- No project parameter needed
- For users with one primary knowledge base

**Configuration:**

Set
```json
{
  "default_project": "main",
  "default_project_mode": true
}
```
in ~/.basic-memory/config.json

**Example:**
```
You: "Create a note about today's meeting"
Claude: [Uses write_note(title="Meeting", content="...", project=auto)]
‚úì Created in main project (default)

You: "Search for project planning"
Claude: [Uses search_notes(query="project planning", project=auto)]
Found 5 notes in main project
```

### Constrained Project Mode

Specify a particular project to use for the MCP session.

**Locked to specific project**
- Start with `--project project-name`
- All operations locked to specified project
- Prevents accidental cross-project operations
- For automation and focused work sessions

Started with `basic-memory mcp --project work-notes`:

```
You: "Document the new API architecture"
Claude: [Uses write_note(title="API Architecture", project=constrained)]
‚úì Created in work-notes project

You: "Find database documentation"
Claude: [Uses search_notes(query="database", project=constrained)]
Found 3 database notes in work-notes project
```

### Project Resolution Hierarchy

1. **Projct CLI arg** (highest priority) - `--project` parameter
2. **Explicit Parameter** (medium priority) - `project` parameter in tool call
3. **Default Project Mode** (lowest priority) - Automatic default when enabled

### Details

**What changed:**

- ‚ùå **Removed**: `switch_project()` and `get_current_project()` tools
- ‚úì **Added**: Explicit `project` parameter to all content tools
- ‚úì **Added**: Three project modes for different workflows
- ‚úì **Added**: `list_memory_projects()` with session guidance
- ‚úì **Enhanced**: `recent_activity()` with discovery mode

**Before:**
```python
switch_project("work-notes")
write_note("My Note", "Content")
search_notes("query")
```

**After:**
```python
# Multi-project mode
list_memory_projects()  # Discover projects
write_note("My Note", "Content", project="work-notes")
search_notes("query", project="work-notes")

# Default project mode (config: default_project_mode=true)
write_note("My Note", "Content")  # Uses default project automatically
search_notes("query")  # Searches default project

# Constrained mode (CLI: --project work-notes)
write_note("My Note", "Content")  # Uses constrained project
search_notes("query")  # Searches constrained project
```

# v0.14.0

as the source of truth, so there is no risk of data loss. You can see the status any time.

```
You: what is the sync status?

Claude:

**Current Status**: üîÑ Syncing 1 projects (231/331 files, 70%)
**System Ready**: üîÑ Processing

üîÑ **File synchronization in progress**

Basic Memory is automatically processing all configured projects and building knowledge graphs.
This typically takes 1-3 minutes depending on the amount of content.

**Currently Processing:**
- **main**: Processing new files (231/331, 70%)

**What's happening:**
- Scanning and indexing markdown files
- Building entity and relationship graphs
- Setting up full-text search indexes
- Processing file changes and updates

**What you can do:**
- Wait for automatic processing to complete - no action needed
- Use this tool again to check progress
- Simple operations may work already
- All projects will be available once sync finishes

**Note**: All configured projects will be automatically synced during startup.
You don't need to manually switch projects - Basic Memory handles this for you.
```
