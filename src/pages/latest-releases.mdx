### Breaking Changes & Migration

<Warning>
**Project workflow changes:**
- AI assistants will ask which project to use at conversation start
- You can still switch projects mid-conversation by saying "switch to project 'foo'"
- The assistant remembers your current project throughout the conversation

**Migration:** No action required - conversations will work naturally with the new workflow. Single-project users can enable `default_project_mode` in config to skip the selection prompt.
</Warning>

**What's changed for users:**
1. **Project selection** - AI asks which project to use when starting conversations
2. **Flexible switching** - Tell the AI to switch projects anytime during the conversation
3. **Single-project mode** - Enable `default_project_mode` in `~/.basic-memory/config.json` to automatically use your default project

See [What's New](/whats-new#v0.15.0) for complete details and [Getting Started](/getting-started#multi-project-setup) for setup guidance.
