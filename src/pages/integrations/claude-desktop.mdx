Claude Desktop is the recommended way to use Basic Memory. Integration through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) gives Claude direct access to your knowledge base.

## Cloud Setup

Basic Memory Cloud provides hosted MCP access with no local installation required.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">
    Create your account at [app.basicmemory.com](https://app.basicmemory.com)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Remote MCP Connector (Claude)">
    In Claude Desktop, go to **Settings → Claude → Connectors**

    Click "Add connector" and enter:
    - **Name**: Basic Memory
    - **Remote MCP server URL**: `https://cloud.basicmemory.com/mcp`

    ![Add connector](/claude-settings-add-connector.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Click "Connect" and follow the OAuth flow to grant permissions

    ![Configure connector](/claude-settings-configure.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Setup">
    In Claude, click the tools icon (🔨) to see Basic Memory tools

    ![Tools menu](/claude-settings-tools.png)

    Try Prompting: `List my projects`
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
See the [Cloud Setup Guide](/guides/cloud) for detailed instructions, web editor usage, and troubleshooting.

## Local Installation

### Prerequisites

<Info>
- `uv` **must be installed and available in your system PATH**. Claude Desktop runs in its own isolated environment and needs `uv` to manage dependencies.
- **On macOS, install `uv` globally with Homebrew**: `brew install uv`. This ensures Claude Desktop can detect it.
</Info>

### Configure Claude Desktop

Edit your Claude Desktop config, located at:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`


```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "basic-memory",
        "mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Install Basic Memory (Optional)

```bash
# Stable release (recommended)
uv tool install basic-memory
# or: pip install basic-memory

# Beta releases (new features, testing)
pip install basic-memory --pre

# Development builds (latest changes)
pip install basic-memory --pre --force-reinstall
```

### Restart Claude Desktop

After saving the config, restart Claude Desktop. You should see Basic Memory tools available in the tools menu (hammer icon in bottom-right).

## Features

### Core Capabilities

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Knowledge Creation">
    Create and update notes through natural conversation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Knowledge Search">
    Find information across your entire knowledge base
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context Building">
    Load context from previous conversations using memory:// URLs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Project Management">
    Work with multiple knowledge projects in each conversation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Visual Note Display">
    View notes as formatted artifacts for better readability
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Real-time Sync

Changes you make to files are immediately available in conversations:

1. Edit a file in any text editor
2. Save the changes
3. Ask Claude to read the note - it will see your updates

### Memory URLs

Reference specific knowledge with `memory://` URLs:

```
You: "Take a look at memory://project-planning and let's continue our discussion"
```

Claude will load that specific note and any related context.

## Common Workflows

### Creating Knowledge

**During a conversation:**
```
You: "Could you create a note summarizing our discussion about API design?"
Claude: I'll create a note capturing our API design discussion...
[Creates structured note with observations and relations]
```

**Building on existing knowledge:**
```
You: "Add a section about authentication to my API documentation"
Claude: [Uses edit_note to append new content without rewriting]
```

### Searching and Discovery

**Find information:**
```
You: "What did we decide about the database schema?"
Claude: [Searches knowledge base and provides relevant information]
```

**View formatted notes:**
```
You: "Show me the project documentation as a formatted artifact"
Claude: [Uses view_note to display the note as a readable artifact]
```

**Recent activity:**
```
You: "What have we been working on lately?"
Claude: [Shows recently modified notes and offers to continue discussions]
```

### Project Management

Projects are selected at the start of each conversation. Claude will suggest your most active project and ask which one to use.

**Starting a conversation:**
```
You: "Let's organize my personal notes"

Claude: I see you have 3 projects: main, work-notes, personal
Your most active project is personal
Should I use personal for this task?

You: "Yes"
```

**For single-project users**, add this to `~/.basic-memory/config.json`:
```json
{
  "default_project": "main",
  "default_project_mode": true
}
```

This skips project selection and uses your default project automatically.

## Advanced Usage

### Special Prompts

Basic Memory includes prompts that trigger specific behaviors:

- **"Continue our conversation about [topic]"** - Loads relevant context
- **"What have we been discussing recently?"** - Shows recent activity
- **"Find information about [topic]"** - Searches knowledge base

### Incremental Editing

Instead of rewriting entire notes, Claude can edit incrementally:

- **Append**: Add new sections to existing notes
- **Prepend**: Add content to the beginning
- **Replace sections**: Update specific parts
- **Find and replace**: Make targeted text changes

### File Organization

Claude can help organize your knowledge base:

- Move notes to appropriate folders
- Archive old content
- Create directory structures
- Maintain database consistency during moves

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Claude can't find Basic Memory tools">
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify `uv` is installed: `which uvx`
    - Check config file syntax is valid JSON
    - Restart Claude Desktop after config changes
    - Try absolute path to uvx in config
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Tools appear but don't work">
    **Solutions:**
    - Check Basic Memory is installed: `basic-memory --version`
    - Verify sync is running: `basic-memory status`
    - Check file permissions in `~/basic-memory`
    - Look for error messages in Claude Desktop
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Changes not syncing">
    **Solutions:**
    - Confirm real-time sync is enabled (default)
    - Check `basic-memory status` for sync status
    - Restart sync: `basic-memory sync --watch`
    - Verify file is in the correct project directory
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Getting Help

```bash
# Check installation
basic-memory --version

# View sync status
basic-memory status

# Get help with commands
basic-memory --help
```

## Best Practices

### Knowledge Creation

1. **Use descriptive titles** - They become link targets
2. **Add semantic observations** - Categorize information
3. **Create relations** - Connect related concepts
4. **Use tags** - Enable better search
5. **Review AI-generated content** - Edit for accuracy

### Conversation Management

1. **Reference existing knowledge** - Use memory:// URLs
2. **Build incrementally** - Add to existing notes
3. **Use multiple projects** - Organize knowledge by context (work, personal, etc.)
4. **Use special prompts** - Leverage built-in behaviors
5. **Organize regularly** - Keep knowledge base clean

### Performance

1. **Archive old content** - Keep active knowledge focused
2. **Use meaningful filenames** - Improve discoverability
3. **Regular backups** - Use git for version control
4. **Monitor project size** - Check with `basic-memory project info`
