## Setup

### Setting Up Obsidian with Basic Memory

You can either create a new vault for Basic Memory or configure Basic Memory to use your existing vault.

#### Option 1: Use an Existing Obsidian Vault

If you have an existing Obsidian vault where you want Basic Memory to save notes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Basic Memory project">
```bash
# Point Basic Memory to your existing vault
basic-memory project add main ~/path/to/your/obsidian-vault

# Set it as default
basic-memory project default main
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Claude Desktop">
Restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the integration">
Ask Claude to create a note - it will now appear in your existing vault
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Option 2: Create a New Vault for Basic Memory

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download Obsidian">
Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new vault">
Create a new vault in Obsidian pointing to your Basic Memory directory (~/basic-memory by default)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable core plugins">
Enable core plugins like Graph View, Backlinks, and Tags
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Visualization Features

### Graph View

Obsidian's Graph View provides a visual representation of your knowledge network:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Node Representation">
    Each document appears as a node
  </Card>
  <Card title="Connection Lines">
    Relations appear as connections between nodes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Color Customization">
    Colors can be customized to distinguish types
  </Card>
  <Card title="Filter Options">
    Filters let you focus on specific aspects
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
Local graphs show connections for individual documents, providing focused views of specific areas in your knowledge base.
</Info>

### Backlinks

Obsidian automatically tracks references between documents:

- View all documents that reference the current one
- See the exact context of each reference
- Navigate easily through connections
- Track how concepts relate to each other

### Tag Explorer

Use tags to organize and filter content:

- View all tags in your knowledge base
- See how many documents use each tag
- Filter documents by tag combinations
- Create hierarchical tag structures

## Knowledge Elements

Basic Memory's knowledge format works natively with Obsidian:

### Wiki Links

```markdown
## Relations
- implements [[Search Design]]
- depends_on [[Database Schema]]
```

<Note>
These display as clickable links in Obsidian and appear in the graph view.
</Note>

### Observations with Tags

```markdown
## Observations
- [tech] Using SQLite #database
- [design] Local-first #architecture
```

Tags become searchable and filterable in Obsidian's tag pane.

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: Document Title
type: note
tags: [search, design]
---
```

Frontmatter provides metadata for Obsidian to use in search and filtering.

## Canvas Integration

Basic Memory can create [Obsidian Canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas) files:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask Claude to create a visualization">
```example
You: "Create a canvas showing the structure of our project components."
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claude generates a .canvas file">
The file is automatically created in your knowledge base
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the file in Obsidian">
View and edit the visual representation in Obsidian
  </Step>
  <Step title="Canvas files maintain references">
Canvas files keep live references to your documents
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Recommended Plugins

These Obsidian plugins work especially well with Basic Memory:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Dataview">
    Query your knowledge base programmatically
  </Card>
  <Card title="Kanban">
    Organize tasks from knowledge files
  </Card>
  <Card title="Calendar">
    View and navigate temporal knowledge
  </Card>
  <Card title="Templates">
    Create consistent knowledge structures
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

- Context around ideas

### Search and Navigation

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Quick Switcher">
    Rapidly navigate between documents using Cmd/Ctrl + O
  </Card>
  <Card title="Global Search">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Visual Customization

You can customize how your knowledge appears in Obsidian:

```css
/* Custom CSS for Basic Memory observations */
.observation-tech {
  color: #4A90E2;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.observation-design {
  color: #7ED321;

  padding: 2px 4px;
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```
