## Using with Basic Memory Cloud

Basic Memory Cloud enables a hybrid workflow: edit locally in Obsidian while your notes sync to the cloud.

<Note>
Sync requires the Basic Memory CLI. See [Local Installation](/getting-started#local-installation) for installation steps.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up for Basic Memory Cloud">
    Create your account at [app.basicmemory.com](https://app.basicmemory.com)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Cloud Mode">
    Authenticate and enable cloud mode:

    ```bash
    bm cloud login
    ```

    This enables cloud mode and validates your subscription.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Sync">
    Install rclone and configure credentials:

    ```bash
    bm cloud setup
    ```

    This installs rclone automatically and configures your cloud credentials.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Project with Local Sync">
    Point Basic Memory to your Obsidian vault:

    ```bash
    # If you have an existing vault
    bm project add my-vault --local-path ~/path/to/obsidian-vault

    # Or create a new project for a new vault
    bm project add notes --local-path ~/Documents/notes
    ```

    This creates the project on cloud and prepares local sync.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Establish Sync Baseline">
    Preview and run the initial sync:

    ```bash
    # Preview first (recommended)
    bm project bisync --name my-vault --resync --dry-run

    # If all looks good, establish baseline
    bm project bisync --name my-vault --resync
    ```

    This creates the initial sync state. Only use `--resync` for the first sync.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Your Vault in Obsidian">
    Open your local directory as a vault in Obsidian. Continue editing locally with full graph view, plugins, and IDE features.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sync Changes">
    After editing in Obsidian or making changes in cloud (via AI assistants), run bidirectional sync:

    ```bash
    bm project bisync --name my-vault
    ```

    This syncs changes in both directions - edit locally or in cloud, both stay in sync.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Bidirectional sync**: `bisync` keeps local and cloud in sync automatically. Changes flow both ways, with newer files winning conflicts. For one-way sync options and advanced configuration, see the [Cloud Sync Guide](/guides/cloud-sync).
</Note>

## Setup

### Setting Up Obsidian with Basic Memory

You can either create a new vault for Basic Memory or configure Basic Memory to use your existing vault.

#### Option 1: Use an Existing Obsidian Vault

If you have an existing Obsidian vault where you want Basic Memory to save notes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Basic Memory project">
```bash
# Point Basic Memory to your existing vault
basic-memory project add main ~/path/to/your/obsidian-vault

# Set it as default
basic-memory project default main
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Claude Desktop">
Restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the integration">
Ask Claude to create a note - it will now appear in your existing vault
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Option 2: Create a New Vault for Basic Memory

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download Obsidian">
Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new vault">
Create a new vault in Obsidian pointing to your Basic Memory directory (~/basic-memory by default)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable core plugins">
Enable core plugins like Graph View, Backlinks, and Tags
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Visualization Features

### Graph View

Obsidian's Graph View provides a visual representation of your knowledge network:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Node Representation">
    Each document appears as a node
  </Card>
  <Card title="Connection Lines">
    Relations appear as connections between nodes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Color Customization">
    Colors can be customized to distinguish types
  </Card>
  <Card title="Filter Options">
    Filters let you focus on specific aspects
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
Local graphs show connections for individual documents, providing focused views of specific areas in your knowledge base.
</Info>

### Backlinks

Obsidian automatically tracks references between documents:

- View all documents that reference the current one
- See the exact context of each reference
- Navigate easily through connections
- Track how concepts relate to each other

### Tag Explorer

Use tags to organize and filter content:

- View all tags in your knowledge base
- See how many documents use each tag
- Filter documents by tag combinations
- Create hierarchical tag structures

## Knowledge Elements

Basic Memory's knowledge format works natively with Obsidian:

### Wiki Links

```markdown
## Relations
- implements [[Search Design]]
- depends_on [[Database Schema]]
```

<Note>
These display as clickable links in Obsidian and appear in the graph view.
</Note>

### Observations with Tags

```markdown
## Observations
- [tech] Using SQLite #database
- [design] Plain-text #architecture
```

Tags become searchable and filterable in Obsidian's tag pane.

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: Document Title
type: note
tags: [search, design]
---
```

Frontmatter provides metadata for Obsidian to use in search and filtering.

## Canvas Integration

Basic Memory can create [Obsidian Canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas) files:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask Claude to create a visualization">
```example
You: "Create a canvas showing the structure of our project components."
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claude generates a .canvas file">
The file is automatically created in your knowledge base
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the file in Obsidian">
View and edit the visual representation in Obsidian
  </Step>
  <Step title="Canvas files maintain references">
Canvas files keep live references to your documents
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Recommended Plugins

These Obsidian plugins work especially well with Basic Memory:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Dataview">
    Query your knowledge base programmatically
  </Card>
  <Card title="Kanban">
    Organize tasks from knowledge files
  </Card>
  <Card title="Calendar">
    View and navigate temporal knowledge
  </Card>
  <Card title="Templates">
    Create consistent knowledge structures
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
