Google Gemini provides native support for Basic Memory through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling persistent context across AI sessions and building comprehensive knowledge bases.

## Setup

### Video Tutorial

Watch this quick guide to get started with Basic Memory and Google Gemini:

</div>

### Configure Gemini

Basic Memory works with Gemini through MCP. Install it with:

```bash
gemini mcp add basic-memory bash -c "uvx basic-memory mcp"
```

<Tip>
If you want to use a specific Basic Memory project, modify the command like so:
```bash
gemini mcp add basic-memory bash -c "uvx basic-memory mcp --project your-project-name"
```

You can also install it globally for your profile with:
```bash
gemini mcp add -s user basic-memory bash -c "uvx basic-memory mcp"
```
</Tip>

### Verify Installation

Check that Basic Memory is configured correctly:

```bash
gemini mcp list
```

You should see `basic-memory` listed with the command `bash -c uvx basic-memory mcp` and a Connected status.

## Quick Start

Once configured, you can immediately start using Basic Memory in your workflow:

```
You: "Create a note about our authentication strategy for the API"
Gemini: I'll document the authentication strategy we discussed...
[Creates structured note with technical details and rationale]

You: "Switch to my personal project"
Gemini: [Changes context to personal project knowledge base]
```

## MCP Integration Benefits

Gemini's native MCP support provides:

- **Automatic tool access** - No manual setup required
- **Project-aware context** - Maintains separate knowledge bases per project
- **Real-time sync** - Changes are immediately available
- **Persistent memory** - Context survives between sessions
- **Structured knowledge** - Uses Basic Memory's semantic format

### Available Tools

Through MCP, Gemini can access all Basic Memory functionality:

- **write_note** - Create and update documentation
- **read_note** - Access existing knowledge and context
- **search_notes** - Find relevant information across projects
- **edit_note** - Update documentation incrementally
- **recent_activity** - Check what you've been working on
- **project management** - Switch between different knowledge bases
- **build_context** - Load conversation context from memory:// URLs

## Integration with Development

### Project Context

Basic Memory maintains separate knowledge bases for different projects:

```
You: "Switch to my work project"
Gemini: [Loads work project context and knowledge]

You: "Based on our API design notes, what's the next step?"
Gemini: [References existing documentation to provide contextual guidance]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Gemini can't access Basic Memory">
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify Basic Memory is installed: `basic-memory --version`
    - Check MCP server configuration: `gemini mcp list`
    - Reinstall if needed: `gemini mcp remove basic-memory` then `gemini mcp add basic-memory bash -c "uvx basic-memory mcp"`
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Context not loading from memory:// URLs">
    **Solutions:**
    - Confirm files exist in current project
    - Check memory:// URL syntax (e.g., `memory://folder/note`)
    - Verify sync is working: `basic-memory status`
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Notes not updating">
    **Solutions:**
    - Check file permissions in knowledge base directory
    - Check ~/.basic-memory for logs containing error messages
    - Report error messages to the Basic Memory team
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Performance Tips

- **Multiple projects**: Use separate Basic Memory projects for different use cases
- **Organized structure**: Keep consistent folder organization across projects
- **Regular cleanup**: Archive old projects to maintain performance

## Alternative Usage

If MCP isn't working, you can still use Basic Memory:
