Claude Code provides native support for Basic Memory through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling persistent context across development sessions and building comprehensive coding knowledge.

## Cloud Setup

Basic Memory Cloud provides hosted MCP access with no local installation required.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">
    Create your account at [app.basicmemory.com](https://app.basicmemory.com)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Remote MCP Server">
    In Claude Code, add the remote MCP server:

    ```bash
    claude mcp add basic-memory-cloud --url https://cloud.basicmemory.com/mcp
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Follow the OAuth flow in Claude Code to grant permissions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Setup">
    In Claude Code, check available tools:

    ```
    You: "What tools do you have access to?"
    ```

    You should see Basic Memory tools listed
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
See the [Cloud Setup Guide](/guides/cloud) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.
</Tip>

## Local Setup

### Install Basic Memory cli

```bash
# Install Basic Memory
uv tool install basic-memory

# Or with pip
pip install basic-memory
```

### Configure Claude Code

Basic Memory works automatically with Claude Code through MCP. Install it with:

```bash
claude mcp add basic-memory basic-memory mcp
```

<Info>
You can use the `/mcp` command in Claude Code to check MCP server status and available tools.
</Info>

### Verify Installation

In Claude Code, check that Basic Memory tools are available:

```
You: "What tools do you have access to?"
```

You should see Basic Memory tools listed, including note creation, search, and project management.

## Quick Start

Once configured, you can immediately start using Basic Memory in your development workflow:

```
You: "Create a note about our authentication strategy for the API"
Claude: I'll document the authentication strategy we discussed...
[Creates structured note with technical details and rationale]

You: "Switch to my personal coding project"
Claude: [Changes context to personal project knowledge base]
```

## MCP Integration Benefits

Claude Code's native MCP support provides:

- **Automatic tool access** - No manual setup required
- **Project-aware context** - Maintains separate knowledge bases per project
- **Real-time sync** - Changes are immediately available
- **Persistent memory** - Context survives between sessions
- **Structured knowledge** - Uses Basic Memory's semantic format

### Available Tools

Through MCP, Claude Code can access all Basic Memory functionality:

- **write_note** - Create and update documentation
- **read_note** - Access existing knowledge and context
- **search_notes** - Find relevant information across projects
- **edit_note** - Update documentation incrementally
- **recent_activity** - Check what you've been working on
- **project management** - Switch between different knowledge bases
- **build_context** - Load conversation context from memory:// URLs

## Integration with Development

### CLAUDE.md Enhancement

Claude Code uses CLAUDE.md files for project instructions. Basic Memory complements this by:

- **Storing detailed knowledge** outside the context window
- **Enabling search** across your entire knowledge base
- **Maintaining history** of decisions and learnings
- **Linking related concepts** through relations

### Project Context

Basic Memory maintains separate knowledge bases for different projects:

```
You: "Switch to my work project"
Claude: [Loads work project context and knowledge]

You: "Based on our API design notes, what's the next step?"
Claude: [References existing documentation to provide contextual guidance]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Claude Code can't access Basic Memory">
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify Basic Memory is installed: `basic-memory --version`
    - Check MCP server status: `/mcp` in Claude Code
    - Reinstall if needed: `claude mcp remove basic-memory` then `claude mcp add basic-memory basic-memory mcp`
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Context not loading from memory:// URLs">
    **Solutions:**
    - Confirm files exist in current project
    - Check memory:// URL syntax (e.g., `memory://folder/note`)
    - Verify sync is working: `basic-memory status`
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Notes not updating">
    **Solutions:**
    - Check file permissions in knowledge base directory
    - Check ~/.basic-memory for logs containing error messages
    - Report error messages to the Basic Memory team
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Performance Tips

- **Multiple projects**: Use separate Basic Memory projects for different codebases
- **Organized structure**: Keep consistent folder organization across projects
- **Regular cleanup**: Archive old projects to maintain performance

## Alternative Usage

If MCP isn't working, you can still use Basic Memory:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="CLI Integration">
    Use Basic Memory CLI tools from Claude Code's terminal
  </Card>
  <Card title="File Editing">
    Edit Basic Memory notes directly and sync manually
  </Card>
  <Card title="Manual Context">
    Copy content from Basic Memory into conversations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Parallel Usage">
    Use Claude Desktop alongside Claude Code. With Basic Memory they can see the same notes and share context.
