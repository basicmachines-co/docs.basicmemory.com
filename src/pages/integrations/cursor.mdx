Cursor's AI-powered development environment integrates natively with Basic Memory through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling persistent context across coding sessions.

## Setup


### Configure MCP in Cursor

Cursor supports MCP natively! Configure Basic Memory following the [Cursor MCP documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol).

**Add to Cursor's MCP configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["basic-memory", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Install Basic Memory (optional)

```bash
# Install Basic Memory
uv tool install basic-memory

# Or with pip
pip install basic-memory
```

### Verify Installation

In Cursor, check that Basic Memory tools are available by asking the AI:

```
You: "What tools do you have access to?"
```

You should see Basic Memory tools listed, including note creation, search, and project management.

## Quick Start

Once configured, you can immediately start using Basic Memory in your Cursor conversations:

```
You: "Create a Basic Memory project for this codebase in the docs folder"
Cursor: [Creates project configuration and folder structure]

You: "Document our architecture decisions as we make them"
Cursor: [Creates structured notes with observations and relations]
```

## MCP Integration Benefits

<Info>
Cursor's native MCP support enables seamless Basic Memory integration with:
- Direct tool access in AI conversations
- Real-time knowledge base queries
- Persistent context across coding sessions
- No manual content transfer needed
</Info>

### Available Tools

Through MCP, Cursor can access all Basic Memory tools:

- **write_note** - Create structured documentation
- **read_note** - Access existing knowledge
- **search_notes** - Find relevant information
- **edit_note** - Update documentation incrementally
- **recent_activity** - Check what you've been working on
- **project management** - Switch between different knowledge bases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="MCP tools not appearing in Cursor">
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify Basic Memory is installed: `basic-memory --version`
    - Check MCP configuration syntax in Cursor settings
    - Restart Cursor after configuration changes
    - Try absolute path to uvx if needed
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Tools appear but don't work">
    **Solutions:**
    - Check Basic Memory sync status: `basic-memory status`
    - Verify project directory permissions
    - Ensure uvx can find basic-memory: `which basic-memory`
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Performance issues">
    **Solutions:**
    - Large knowledge bases may slow responses
    - Consider splitting into multiple projects
    - Check available disk space
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
