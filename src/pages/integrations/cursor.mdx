Cursor's AI-powered development environment integrates natively with Basic Memory through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling persistent context across coding sessions.

## Cloud Setup

Basic Memory Cloud provides hosted MCP access with no local installation required.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">
    Create your account at [app.basicmemory.com](https://app.basicmemory.com)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Remote MCP in Cursor">
    In Cursor, go to **Settings → Developer → Edit Config**

    Select **MCP Tools** and click **Add Custom MCP**

    Add Basic Memory Cloud configuration:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "basic-memory-cloud": {
          "url": "https://cloud.basicmemory.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Follow the OAuth flow to grant Cursor access to your Basic Memory account
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Setup">
    In Cursor, ask the AI:

    ```
    You: "What tools do you have access to?"
    ```

    You should see Basic Memory tools listed
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
See the [Cloud Setup Guide](/guides/cloud) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.

## Local Setup

### Configure MCP in Cursor

Cursor supports MCP natively! Configure Basic Memory following the [Cursor MCP documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol).

**Add to Cursor's MCP configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basic-memory": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["basic-memory", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Install Basic Memory (optional)

```bash
# Install Basic Memory
uv tool install basic-memory

# Or with pip
pip install basic-memory
```

### Verify Installation

In Cursor, check that Basic Memory tools are available by asking the AI:

```
You: "What tools do you have access to?"
```

You should see Basic Memory tools listed, including note creation, search, and project management.

## Quick Start

Once configured, you can immediately start using Basic Memory in your Cursor conversations:

```
You: "Create a Basic Memory project for this codebase in the docs folder"
Cursor: [Creates project configuration and folder structure]

You: "Document our architecture decisions as we make them"
Cursor: [Creates structured notes with observations and relations]
```

## MCP Integration Benefits

<Info>
Cursor's native MCP support enables Basic Memory integration with:
- Direct tool access in AI conversations
- Real-time knowledge base queries
- Persistent context across coding sessions
- No manual content transfer needed
</Info>

### Available Tools

Through MCP, Cursor can access all Basic Memory tools:

- **write_note** - Create structured documentation
- **read_note** - Access existing knowledge
- **search_notes** - Find relevant information
- **edit_note** - Update documentation incrementally
- **recent_activity** - Check what you've been working on
- **project management** - Work with multiple knowledge bases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="MCP tools not appearing in Cursor">
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify Basic Memory is installed: `basic-memory --version`
    - Check MCP configuration syntax in Cursor settings
    - Restart Cursor after configuration changes
    - Try absolute path to uvx if needed
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Tools appear but don't work">
    **Solutions:**
    - Check Basic Memory sync status: `basic-memory status`
    - Verify project directory permissions
    - Ensure uvx can find basic-memory: `which basic-memory`
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Performance issues">
    **Solutions:**
    - Large knowledge bases may slow responses
    - Consider splitting into multiple projects
    - Check available disk space
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
